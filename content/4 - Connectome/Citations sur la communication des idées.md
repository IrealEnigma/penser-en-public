“Your ideas don’t suck. Your packaging does.”

“Nobody cares about how great something is until you shine it in the light of its enemy. Frame your opinions, observations, and predictions with what’s wrong with the world. Nobody pays attention to placid posts.”

“There’s no room for a weak message in a crowded market. Speak up or be drowned out.”

“You will never succeed in a content-driven business if you can’t hook and hold attention.”

“Like it or not, it isn’t who has the best ideas. It’s who communicates them best.”

“Social media is a live auction place of ideas. If you pay attention to what catches attention, you can double down on what works and stop wasting time on what doesn’t.”

“Every word you publish should be made to work as hard as possible (robots don’t need holidays).”

“Repurpose. Repost. Redistribute.”
