A problem worth solving is **PURE**:  
‍

‍**P** → **Painful,** which makes the solution more valuable, and also encourages the student to put in the effort to solve it.

A painful problem is among the most important problems in their life. They complain about it all the time to their friends and family.

They might even wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. It’s a “must have” and not a “nice to have”.

For example, ”_It would be nice to have more money_” is not a painful enough problem. But “_I hate my job and I want to quit, so I really need to make money online_” is a really painful problem.  
‍

**U** → **Urgent** which makes people take action quicker because they want to solve this problem now, not in the future.

For example, “_I want to lose weight_” is not very urgent. “_I want to be in shape for my wedding, which is in 4 months!_” is more urgent.  
‍

**R** → **Recognized** by people who want to buy your product online, which proves that enough people want to solve this problem.

To know if the problem is recognized, you can ask yourself if people will spend time and energy complaining about it. If they are already asking for advice, and are actively searching for solutions to it, then it’s a good sign!  
‍

**E** → **Easy** to solve by you because you have specific knowledge or experience.

It’s much easier to create and sell a solution to a problem you managed to solve, and have insider information about. Also, it has the added benefit of giving you more credibility.

>You don’t need to be the best in the world at what you teach, you just need to be better than your students.
