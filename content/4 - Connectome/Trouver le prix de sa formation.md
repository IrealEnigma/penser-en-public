1. **What are the prices like in your niche?  
    ‍**For example, business-oriented courses are generally more expensive than technical or creative courses because you can sell them as a program on which the student would have a return on their investment.
2. **How much do alternative solutions cost?  
    ‍**For example, if you are doing a fitness course, what would be the price of a coach + a gym membership?
3. **What are your competitors’ prices?  
    ‍**There are other courses about the same topic as you want to teach; what are their prices?

If you have a very hard time choosing the price of your course, just choose a price between $100 and $300.
