From an evolutionary perspective, the prefrontal cortex is a newer and less developed part of the brain compared to the limbic system.

As a result, the prefrontal cortex is ‘weaker’ than the limbic system.

That’s why, when we face a task that presents some degree of boredom, complexity, or fear, the limbic system often overrides the prefrontal cortex.

Despite our good intentions and long-term goals, we end up giving in to procrastination and immediate gratification more than we’d like.

When there’s a conflict between immediate gratification and a long-term goal, the limbic system often wins because it’s older in an evolutionary sense and has a more direct influence on our behavior
