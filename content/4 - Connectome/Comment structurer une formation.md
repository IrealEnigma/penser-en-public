**Introduction of a section**

- **What the section will cover  
    **Give a quick overview of the section’s contents.
- **Why is learning this important?**  
    Instead of just telling your students why something is important, you can use storytelling to make it more engaging and relatable.
- **Why are they learning it right now, and what are the goals of this section?**  
    Think of where they are in their learning journey, and where you want them to be by the end of the section.
- **What should they know before getting started, and which tools do they need?**  
    Help your students set up the right environment for learning and getting results.
- **Manage expectations  
    **Clarify what your students should expect out of this section by remaining realistic and encouraging. You can also give them warnings and important notes about the topics you will cover.

**The lessons of the section**

- **Each lesson is about a single concept or big idea  
    **If you have several related ideas, you can just break them into a sequence of lessons. Those perform much better than gigantic mega-lessons.
- **We recommend having 5 to 10 lessons per section  
    **In the same way as above, if your section has 25 lessons, could it possibly be split in two?

**At the end of a section**

- **Let your students celebrate their wins**  
    By encouraging them to share their results in a community, by congratulating them on their progress or by simply helping them realize the progress they made in a satisfying way.
