## Pain: Describe your student's problems

## Origin of the problem: Describe the "hidden" cause of these problems

# 3. Solution

The solution flows logically from the "Source of the problem"

# 4. Results

Try to explain these benefits in a concrete, emotional and visual way. For this, you can use examples, images, before-after sections, vivid descriptions, stories...

Focus on one main benefit, and at most two more secondary benefits. But don’t overdo it.

![[Pasted image 20230627202053.png]]

In this example, each section is a spin on one of three benefits:

1. You’ll take action and (finally) get started
2. You’ll feel more confident in your skills as a YouTuber
3. You’ll never feel overwhelmed again thanks to a repeatable system

Storytelling: your story, a real student's, or your future student’s

‍**What will happen to your customer's life if they do NOT buy your product? How will his problem get worse over time?   
Here are some copy examples:

- "You have two choices...", and then present the outcome of following your course and applying it, and compare it to the outcome of doing nothing.
