# 1. Show the ‘ordinary world’

> “If you’re going to tell a story about a fish out of his customary element, you first have to create a contrast by showing him in his mundane, ordinary world.”

Show before so you can contrast with after. Don’t assume your reader knows your surroundings. Explain where you are, what you’re doing, what’s around. So when you look back, they can see how far you’ve come.

# 2. The call

> “In STAR WARS, it’s Princess Leia’s holographic message to Obi Wan Kenobi, who then asks Luke to join the quest.”

The hero has to be presented with a call to action. There’s a problem, challenge, or quest to go on. There has to be a reason you do something. Make sure you communicate the ‘why’.

# 3. Hesitation

The fear of the unknown is common to us all. How realistic is it that you get the opportunity of a lifetime and jump at the chance? That’s how we’d like it to be but the reality is much more mundane.

- We doubt ourselves
- We stumble
- Sometimes we refuse

Show the human side.

# 4. Encouragement

> “This is Obi Wan giving Luke his father’s light saber”

A mentor presents a new perspective to the hero. They give words of wisdom and encourage the hero to take action. But they can only take them so far…

# 5. ‘Crossing the threshold’

> “The balloon goes up, the romance begins, the spaceship blasts off, the wagon train gets rolling.”

The hero takes the first step. It signifies the story and the path chosen. There is now no turning back. Show the point of no return.

# 6. Tests and helpers

> “The hero is forced to make allies and enemies in the special world, and to pass certain tests and challenges that are part of his/her training.”

The path is littered with trials and tribulations. They all serve as practice, for the main event. Make sure you talk about characters along the way.

# 7. The ‘innermost cave’

> “In many myths the hero has to descend into hell to retrieve a loved one, or into a cave to fight a dragon and gain a treasure.”

Here the hero meets their deepest fear. They walk the path alone, confronting their own demons.

# 8. The ordeal

> “This is a critical moment in any story, an ordeal in which the hero appears to die and be born again.”

This is the moment you question everything.

# 9. ‘Seizing the sword’

> “Having survived death, beaten the dragon, slain the Minotaur, her hero now takes possession of the treasure he’s come seeking”

Signifying success and cementing the hero status. Most often, the hero wins.

# 10. Returning…

> “The hero’s not out of the woods yet.”

The dark forces come for revenge plotting to take back what is theirs.

# 11. Resurrection

> “He is transformed into a new being by his experience.”

Now the hero is transformed by the experience.

# 12. The return

> “but unless he comes back with the elixir or some boon to mankind, he’s doomed to repeat the adventure until he does.”

The hero returns to the normal world but there’s a catch, he or she must have come back with the treasure or the lesson. Otherwise, the journey is wasted.
