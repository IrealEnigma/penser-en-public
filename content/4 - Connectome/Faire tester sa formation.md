**Positive feedback**

- What students love
- What they find useful
- What they engage with

**Constructive (aka “negative but actionable”!) feedback**

- What is confusing
- What is boring
- What is too hard to understand

So pretend you’re a police detective or an anthropologist, empty your minds of all assumptions and start asking people simple questions:

- What motivates you to learn this?
- What is your end goal? 
- What are the main obstacles preventing you from reaching this goal?
- What have you already tried to achieve this goal? Why didn’t it work for you?
- If you could have a 3 hour-free coaching with an experienced [Practitioner in what you are teaching], what questions would you want to ask them?
- How will learning [what you plan on teaching] change your life? Describe a specific situation that will be transformed by what you would learn.
- What are the biggest challenges or hassles you have experienced in [your topic]?
- What was easy, and what was hard for you?
- What could’ve made it easier for you?
- What do you wish you had known when you first started?

To get valuable insights, you actually don’t need that many beta students, about a dozen will be enough.
