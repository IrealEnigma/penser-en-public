- Information is like food. You need to consume the right one and need time to digest it.
- Feedback loops are like boomerangs: you have to analyze what you get in return and adjust accordingly.
- Writing is like gambling: you can’t predict which of your bets will hit the jackpot.
- Writing every day is like training for a marathon. It requires steady practice to build endurance.
- Motivation is like the wind: it comes and goes.
- Your brain is like your car’s engine: it needs a certain heating period to perform at its best.
