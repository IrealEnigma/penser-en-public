“Your ultimate goal isn't building a writing habit. It's falling so in love with interesting ideas that you can’t help but tell the world about them. Writing is the medium—not the objective.” - Julian Shapiro

“There is no right way to write—just like there’s no right way to paint. In this handbook, I present frameworks that reliably work for me. Ultimately, you can break every single rule if your writing is still useful or interesting.” - Julian Shapiro

“Put yourself in a position to synthesize your life experience for others. Teach. Mentor colleagues or call friends to explain the ideas you're working through. While explaining, pay attention to how you explain key concepts: occasionally, you'll articulate the essence of a concept beautifully—and that articulation will make for a great piece of writing.” - Julian Shapiro
