# **4 common mistakes to avoid when creating your USP ‍** 

#knowledge 

1. **Features vs. Benefits**, when writing your USP, it’s better to focus on the benefits rather than on the features of your course. 

For example, for the **SEO for Solopreneurs** course, the author wrote “The minimum maintenance, maximum results guide to putting your traffic & sales on autopilot.”, here, there are mostly benefits which can be summarized as “making more money with your business without much effort. This USP would have been way less impactful if it were “32 videos to help you learn SEO for your business.” 

2. **A USP is not a slogan**, it is not just a memorable motto or phrase but an impactful sentence that focuses on the outcomes and benefits that the person will get out of your course.

For example, “You don’t need talent to learn how to draw” is great as it answers an objection potential customers may have, but the author could also have combined them in an even stronger USP: “Your Go-To Resource for Mastering Architectural Sketching, No Talent Required”. 

3. **Your USP is not a shopping list**, you don’t need to list absolutely everything that your course provides and write a huge sentence with many adjectives and benefits. Just focus on the essentials and don’t list more than 2 benefits. 

For example, **Building a Second Brain**’s USP would have been less convincing if it were “A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life, Become Insanely Productive, Make More Money, and Unlock Your Creative Potential” because it’s listing too many things. 

4. **Not being specific enough** can cause your USP to not be impactful to your Ideal Student Persona, and will make it harder to sell your product. 

For example, “Lose weight quickly” is too broad, whereas "Lose 5 kilos in one month" is more specific and concrete.
