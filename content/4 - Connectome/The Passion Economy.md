# The Passion Economy

![rw-book-cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mwYe0Ur9L._SY160.jpg)

- The essence of the Passion Economy is that a person’s particular set of passions and skills becomes a product or service that is matched to the pressing needs of a particular kind of customer at a particular time.

## Les 3 étapes pour gagner dans la passion economy

1. Définir comment on crée de la valeur
2. Définir pour qui on la crée
3. Définir contre quelle est notre compétition

- Step one: understanding how your business adds and captures value. This crucial step is worth elaborating on. Think of any business that has a shot at success. Someone is doing something that creates value.
    
- The second step is to pick your customer. This might seem odd. One would think that either customers show up or they don’t. But Scott points out that customers are not one undifferentiated mass of identical people. They have different interests, different levels of hunger for your product or service. A business needs to identify the customers it wants, and it should figure out who wants its product enough that it can charge whatever it needs to in order to make the business sustainable.

- The third step, the one that Scott says most people find confusing, is to pick your competition. How can you pick who you’ll compete with? Scott points out that every company has a variety of options in the ways they take their product or service to market. Eitan, again, provides an example. He framed his entire sneaker business around Nike. He talked about Nike. He designed the shoes to look a bit like Nikes. He ordered them from the same factory Nike used. He felt Nike was his competition. That meant that people saw his shoes as cheap Nike knockoffs, and nobody wants to buy cheap Nike knockoffs. He could have chosen a different competitor—for example, the lousiest of discount sneakers. He could then have argued that his product was more durable, more stylish, better performing than the bottom of the barrel. By choosing that competitor and framing his business around capturing its share of the market, he would then have had an easier time seeing his subsequent choices. He would have needed a low-margin, high-volume business strategy. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q231X35&location=599))
    
- the crucial Passion Economy question: What is the value I am creating that is beyond that of similar businesses or services, and who am I creating it for? ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q231X35&location=869))
    

C'est le prix qui définit le coût pas l'inverse

## C'est le prix qui définit le coût pas l'inverse

Quand on crée une formation, il faut se demander : et si je la vendais 2000€ ?  
Alors à ce moment là, on peut commencer à réfléchir à tout ce qu'on pourrait mettre à l'intérieur. Réflechir dans le sens inverse n'a pas de sens. Sinon, le prix et la valeur seront toujours 2 entités distinctes.

- Price should drive costs, not the other way around. It took me a long time to understand the significance of this rule. We are wired to think that price is connected to cost. You calculate the cost of the raw materials you use, the time it takes to produce a good or service, you add some amount for profit, and that’s your price. With intangibles, like our time, we look to competitors and charge around whatever it is they do. This is precisely backward. Think of making a luxury car. You would prefer to have a sense of how much people would pay for a certain degree of luxury before you began choosing the materials to go into the vehicle. You determine the price point, and then you reverse engineer the vehicle in line with those costs that can justify the price. You include the smooth leather but recognize that hand-tooling might bump the car’s cost beyond your optimal price.
