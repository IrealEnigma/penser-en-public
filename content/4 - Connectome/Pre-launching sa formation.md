1. **Announcement email:** self-explanatory!
2. **Storytelling email:** walk your subscribers through their future transformation**‍**
3. **Closing email:** answer frequently asked questions**,** create urgency, and emphasize the cost of inaction

### **Email 1 - Announcing your course**

Here is the structure of the first email:

1. **Pain: Describe your student's problems**  
    What are they struggling with right now? Try to describe it in their own words, and be as specific as possible.
2. **Solution: Announce your product**  
    Present your course as the ideal solution to the problems your subscribers are facing.
3. **List the benefits  
    **What is going to change in their life after taking your course? Explain these benefits in a concrete, emotional and visual way. For this, you can use examples, images, before-after sections, changes in behavior... 
4. **Call to Action #1: "Get it today"**  
    This link will redirect to your sales page.
5. **Why a paid product?**  
    You've always created free content — and that won't change. Explain that you want to offer something more complete to those who want to go further in **[your topic]** and support you.
6. **Explain the pre-launch concept**  
    Tell them what advantages they get by signing up now.
7. **Short reminder of the benefits of your online course**  
    Remind your readers of the benefits of your course in a few bullet points. 
8. **Urgency**  
    Tell your readers about the deadline to take advantage of your pre-launch offer (it could be anytime from 3 to 7 days).
9. **Call to Action #2: "Get it today"**  
    This link will redirect to your sales page.**‍**
10. **Add “PS: You can respond to this email if you have any questions about the course.”  
    ‍**This will surface all the questions you didn’t think to answer in the sales page. Obviously, you want to answer each email, but think also of updating your FAQ section in your third email and on your sales page.

Here are 2 key elements you can implement in each email title to increase your open rate:**  
  
1. **Curiosity** to attract the attention of your readers among the multiple emails they receive each day. For this, you can talk about something counter-intuitive, or simply add the word “Announcement” at the beginning of your title because new things also make people curious.  
  
**2. Strong Promises**, which make your email more desirable. To do so, you can use a shortened version of your value proposition or of your course’s main benefits.  
  

For example "**Announcement: The proven method to gain 30k YouTube subscribers in 1 year**" is intriguing because people interested in starting a YouTube channel will be hooked from the get-go, and it contains the value proposition of the course, which makes it desirable, whereas "**Learn how to grow your YouTube channel**" is generic and forgettable.

### **Email 2 - Storytelling**

The goal of your storytelling email is to let your reader visualize their future success. You can tell your own story, a beta student’s, or simply guide your reader in imagining their own future.

Your quick story will contain 3 main elements:

- The initial situation
- The solution
- The result

Here is the structure of your second email:

1. **The initial situation**  
    Show your reader a situation with struggles they can relate to.
2. **The false solution(s)**  
    Your protagonist tries existing solutions, but they don’t end up working.
3. **Things get worse**  
    Because their problems were not solved, they get worse, and the protagonist hits “rock bottom”.
4. **The revelation**  
    The protagonist discovers a new method that actually solves their problems. 
5. **The result**  
    Describe the protagonist’s life now that his problems were solved.
6. **Call to Action #1: "You can do it too"**  
    This link will redirect to your sales page.
7. **Short reminder of the benefits of your online course**  
    Remind your readers of the benefits of your course in a few bullet points.
8. **Urgency**  
    Tell your readers about  the deadline to take advantage of your pre-launch. Example: “You have until Friday at midnight to join the program”.
9. **Call to Action #2: "Start today"**  
    This link will redirect to your sales page.**‍**
10. **Add “PS: You can respond to this email if you have any questions about the course.”**

### **Email 3 - Close**

This will be the most “salesy” email in your sequence, so make it count!

Here’s what should be inside:

12. **Urgency**  
    Remind your readers of the deadline for joining the course.  
    **Example**: “This is the last day to join the program. Doors close at midnight.”
2. **Call to Action #1: "Join [Your product name] and get [The main benefit of your course]"**  
    This link will redirect to your sales page.
3. **Frequently Asked Questions**  
    Answer the main objections and questions you received from your community from the last 2 emails. You can also paste the answers from the sales page FAQ, since not everyone will read it to the end.
4. **Cost of Inaction**  
    Explain how their problem will get worse if they don’t take action today.
5. **Call to Action #2: "Join [Your product name] and get [The main benefit of your course]"**  
    This link will redirect to your sales page.
6. **Add “PS: You can respond to this email if you have any questions about the course.”**  
    You can answer directly and probably get a few extra sales.
