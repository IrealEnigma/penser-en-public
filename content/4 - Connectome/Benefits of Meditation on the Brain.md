[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/) by Dr. Sara Lazar, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School, has found that meditation has a positive effect on the brain. She says:

> “We found that the more hours a person had been practicing meditation, the more profound the changes were in the brain.”

Lazar’s study specifically found that frequent meditators had **increased grey matter in their prefrontal cortex.**

In simplified terms, the more grey matter in someone’s brain (or a specific region of the brain), the more effective their brain (or brain region) is.

Furthermore, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6671286/) has found that **frequent meditation decreases activity in the amygdala,** which is part of the limbic system.

In other words, meditation helps to build a better-working prefrontal cortex and keep our limbic system under control, which puts us in a much better position to overcome procrastination.
