The limbic system is the emotional and impulsive part of our brain.

This is often called our ‘reptile’ brain, as it’s a much older part of the brain (from an evolutionary perspective).

“The limbic system reacts to immediate sensory information, such as pleasure and pain, without thinking about future consequences.”
