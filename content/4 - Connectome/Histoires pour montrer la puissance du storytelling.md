- In 2009, a journalist by the name of Rob Walker, wanted to find out: Is storytelling really the most powerful tool of all? In order to do this, he went on his computer and bought 200 objects from eBay.

	The average price of the objects was about one dollar. He then called 200 authors, and asked them, “Hey, would you like to be part of the ‘significant object study’? Which meant that I would like you to write a story about one of the objects.” And 200 authors said yes. So there he had 200 objects, he had 200 stories.

	He went on eBay again with all the 200 objects. Would there be a difference? Would there be a change? Do you think there was a change?

	One of the objects was this beautiful horse’s head. This beautiful horse’s head was bought for 99¢ and was sold, when the story was added, for $62.95. That is a slight increase of 6395%. So, was this a one-off situation? Not really, because he bought the 200 objects for a total of $129, selling them for $8000. Now, that’s insane. — Story by JP Phillips [1]
