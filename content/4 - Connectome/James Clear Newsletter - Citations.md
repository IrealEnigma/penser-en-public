“Be ruthless about what you ignore. Time, energy, and resources are so precious. You have to be ferocious about cutting your priorities—more than you realize and certainly more than is comfortable.

You can only deeply commit to a few things. One or two? Maybe three?

Writer and programmer **Simon Sarris** shares the secret to a good morning:

“The secret to waking up is to wake up way earlier than you have to. When you have 1-2 hours where you can just sit there calmly, drinking coffee, and not be rushed, you feel ten times better. Later on, you can work on being productive in the morning too, if you please.”

Author **Karl Ove Knausgard** on being fully immersed in life:

“What makes life worth living? No child asks itself that question. To children life is self-evident. Life goes without saying: whether it is good or bad makes no difference. This is because children don’t see the world, don’t observe the world, don’t contemplate the world, but are so deeply immersed in the world that they don’t distinguish between it and their own selves.”

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

It’s remarkable how uncomplicated it is most of the time. The hard part is not knowing what to do, but having the resolve to do it. What is one thing you know you should do right now and you just need to step up and do it?
