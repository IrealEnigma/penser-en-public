## Step 1: Character Development

A story without a character is like a body without a soul.

Every story has its main character which we call "**_Protagonist_**".

The first 10 minutes of the story describes what he/she wants throughout the story.

Let’s take an example of my personal fat-loss story which I’ve already published on medium. Just search "**_Yugant Nakhawa Fat Loss_**". You will get that story on Medium.

> I described how I was ashamed of myself, how it affected my mental health and every other problem related to it.

Read the introduction part of my story, you will learn how to develop a character of your story.

## Step 2: Character's Problem

Now we know who our character is. Let's identify his/her problem.

In my case the problem was obesity.

I revealed about my anxiety issues and how even after trying everything there were no results.

Here I was facing the point of frustration which is also called as "**_Tipping Point_**".

Similarly you’ve to identify your character’s pain point i.e. problem.

## Step 3: Turning Point (Change)

Now we know who our character is. Also we know his/her problem.

Let’s find out what happened after that.

In my case, I quit every unhealthy food item and changed all my eating habits.

> In the beginning, the results weren’t visible. But slowly as I crossed the tipping point, things started changing.
> 
> From losing 1-2 kgs a month to losing 5-6 kgs a month, changes became rapid.

So this is the turning point of my story.

## Step 4: Step-By-Step Guide

Now when you've already achieved the results for yourself. You can guide others to achieve the same for them.

> As change first starts with you but later you inspire thousands. The same metric applies here.

In my case, I explained everything that helped me lose weight in 5 months.

In storytelling, It is called the “**_Moral of the story_**".

Basically you’ve to share what he/she has learned throughout their journey.
