One heuristic to tell how good someone is at making decisions is how much time they have. The busiest people are often the ones who make the worst decisions. Not only do they have less time to dedicate to thinking about the problem, but they are often busy correcting poor decisions from the past.

Bad decisions accumulate, making your position increasingly worse. You can think of it a bit like playing Tetris. When you’re in a bad position, you need just the right piece to clear the board. When you’re in a good position, it doesn’t matter what comes next.

Good decision-makers understand a simple truth: you can’t make good decisions without good thinking, and good thinking requires time.
