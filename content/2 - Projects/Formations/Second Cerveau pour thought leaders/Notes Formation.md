Ahrens offers four guidelines in creating literature notes:
Be extremely selective in what you decide to keepKeep the overall note as short as possibleUse your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatimWrite down the bibliographic details on the source

Luhmann realized that a note was only as valuable as its context – its network of associations, relationships, and connections to other information.

We build the same connections in our heads as we deliberately develop them in our slip-box.

Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box

Students in most educational institutions are not encouraged to independently build a network of connections between different kinds of information.

“When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).”

It is easy to think we understand a concept until we try to put it in our own words.

Deliberate practice is the best way to get better at anything, and in this case, you are deliberately practicing the most fundamental skill of all: thinking.

If you want to learn and remember something long-term, you have to write it down. If you want to understand an idea, you have to translate it into your own words.

By creating notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann anticipated hypertext and URLs.

What does the author try to say? How does that resonate with what I already know? How is it different to what other authors are saying?

Try to take these notes in your own words.

Don’t just capture ideas, develop them, remix them, contradict them.

When you’ve finished a book, go through your Literature Notes and create Permanent Notes from them. Ecrire une note par concept, idée…

“Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.

The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.
