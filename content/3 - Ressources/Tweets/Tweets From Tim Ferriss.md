## Highlights
- **Personally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). Here’s my coping mechanism and process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things):**
  1) Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.
  2) Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.
  3) Write down the 3-5 things—and no more—that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted from one day’s to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually = most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict.
  4) For each item, ask yourself:
  – “If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?”
  – “Will moving this forward make all the other to-do’s unimportant or easier to knock off later?”
  5) Look only at the items you’ve answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions.
  6) Block out at least 2-3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.
  7) TO BE CLEAR: Block out at least 2-3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work.
  8) If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.
  Congratulations! That’s it.
  This is the only way I can create big outcomes despite my never-ending impulse to procrastinate, nap, and otherwise fritter away my days with bullshit. 
  If I have 10 important things to do in a day, it’s 100% certain nothing important will get done that day. On the other hand, I can usually handle 1 must-do item and block out my lesser behaviors for 2-3 hours a day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1716836684661453094))
- Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?” 
  Don’t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities. You’ll just read unassociated e-mail and scramble your brain for the day. Compile your to-do list for tomorrow no later than this evening. I don’t recommend using digital to-do lists, because it is possible to add an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of paper folded in half three times, which fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items. 
  There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn’t necessary if they’re actually high-impact. 
  If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day? 
  To counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself: What will happen if I don’t do this, and is it worth putting off the important to do it? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/1725914309677514999))
