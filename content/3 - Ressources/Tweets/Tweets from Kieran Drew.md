## Highlights
- **How to stand out on social media (without selling out):**
  It‚Äôs getting harder to get noticed on ùïè. Out of all the content you could create, there are only 3 things you should focus on ‚Äî the 3 pillars of magnetic writing.
  A breakdown:
  1**) Actionable advice
  **
  Trends come and go, but being useful will never go out of fashion. Why? Because people are always searching for solutions to their problems. The trick is to make your advice unique from the crowd‚Äôs.
  ‚Ä¢ L**essons and mistakes:** Earned experience
  ‚Ä¢ I**deas:** Unique mechanisms and concepts (like the 3 pillars of magnetic writing)
  ‚Ä¢ S**ystems:** Create simple strategies to help your audience go from point A to point B
  ‚Ä¢ P**redictions:** What is no one talking about that you think is true?
  Share one idea daily to help your audience win.
  2**) Personality
  **
  There‚Äôre thousands of people in your niche. None are just like you. You need to show your values, worldviews, and beliefs to give your reader a chance to resonate.
  ‚Ä¢ What pisses you off?
  ‚Ä¢ What makes you weird?
  ‚Ä¢ What quirks can you lean into?
  ‚Ä¢ What do you believe strongly about that most people don‚Äôt?
  Don‚Äôt try to be the writer for everyone. Be THE writer for someone.
  3**) Storytelling
  **
  People can steal your content, but they can never steal your story.
  ‚Ä¢ What have you overcome?
  ‚Ä¢ What beliefs have you changed?
  ‚Ä¢ What difficult decisions have you made?
  ‚Ä¢ What advice or adventure has most changed your life?
  ‚Ä¢ What have you achieved that few people have (or what do you want to achieve?)
  But remember: storytelling is not really about you. It‚Äôs about the reader. Always bring it back to them.
