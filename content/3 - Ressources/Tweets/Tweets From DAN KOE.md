## Highlights
- If you don’t have ideas, read.
  If you have ideas, but can’t articulate them, write.
  If you have ideas, and the clarity to execute, build.
  Expand, organize, and focus your mind until your craziest ideas become reality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1728373220246454457))
