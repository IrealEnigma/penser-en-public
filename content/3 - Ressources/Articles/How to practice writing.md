## Highlights
- Your ultimate goal isn't building a writing habit. It's falling so in love with interesting ideas that you can’t help but tell the world about them. Writing is the medium—not the objective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqt7d6hacqp6mzgsjaa4r0g))
- Don't wait for an idea to be fully formed before writing. You write in order to think through the idea. The act of writing compels your brain to connect the dots. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqt96ykbcaapk0ff6dszznd))
- Avoid guessing what readers want. Instead, be a proxy: Selfishly entertain and surprise yourself, and you'll entertain and surprise many of them too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqt9n6zaqj7ep9dacdqf5x9))
- Your writing is succinct once everything unimportant is removed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqt9t00gaygb2p8m5mtv6ah))
- Your writing is intriguing once the average reader effortlessly makes it to the end. A hook, peak, and satisfying ending are your trifecta of intrigue. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqta5zt3m782gb4t26320am))
- Rewriting your thoughts to be clear, succinct, and intriguing is a lot of work. You won't love writing until you find a way to love rewriting. Make a game out of it by seeing how concise you can make it without losing its resonance and complexity. And see how page-turning you can make it—do readers consistently get to the end?

- There is no right way to write—just like there’s no right way to paint. In this handbook, I present frameworks that reliably work for me. Ultimately, you can break every single rule if your writing is still useful or interesting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtbymzabp2qfwdcxp2c4tt))
- I became a writer when two things were true:
  1. I had strong opinions to express and nagging questions to answer.
  2. I could build the discipline to fully reason through my ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtdefgkznbvjgrn8acf4za))
- And I'm ready to write a given post once I've reached two thresholds:
  • I can't shake the idea. It won't stop nagging me.
  • I've uncovered at least one novel insight about it. (I'll unravel more through the process of writing and rewriting.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqte0c5fpz9ne0djbq4teth))
- Put yourself in a position to synthesize your life experience for others. Teach. Mentor colleagues or call friends to explain the ideas you're working through. While explaining, pay attention to how you explain key concepts: occasionally, you'll articulate the essence of a concept beautifully—and that articulation will make for a great piece of writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtf46ymd9kz16vyzg6anym))
- Write in order to make sense of your mind and the world around you. Accept that most of writing's value comes from helping you clarify your own logic. The resulting clarity makes you a wiser speaker and decision-maker.
  When clarity is your goal, having an audience matters less. For a writer to have a long career, I find it's critical to approach writing this way.
  Fortunately, getting to the bottom of the ideas you passionately care about is also how you grow a loyal audience. Thanks to the algorithmic nature of Twitter, YouTube, and SEO, truly great and authentic content eventually surfaces over time.

- If you're frozen by the fear of judgment, you can hedge against it:
  • Add a disclaimer to your writing: "I'm sharing early thoughts. I encourage readers to share their own experiences to help refine my thinking."
  • Instead of sharing original ideas, curate those of others'. Many newsletters, blogs, and Twitter accounts exclusively curate third-party content. Over time, you can weave your original thoughts alongside the curated ones. Continually increase the portion that's original until you're comfortable being a dominant voice at the forefront.
  Candidly, an unspoken ingredient to writing success is having a bit of shamelessness about getting things wrong in public. Too much shamelessness means you're a charlatan. But too little means you'll never publish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtmhjx7whe5aajcv9g9rx0))
- Procrastination is the result of two reflexes: 
  1. Indulging in immediate rewards like browsing YouTube instead of writing.
  2. Avoiding work you perceive to be uncomfortable or tedious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtnabnrzg7n74aww7g61yn))
- Speed past tedium
  One trick for getting yourself to write is to only write sections that immediately interest you. Perhaps it's the middle of a post—that's okay. You don't have to write in order. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtqx5maw82e2w98td3pkc4))
- • Focus on the ideas you can't get out of your head.
  • When struck by inspiration, sit down and speed through a few paragraphs.
  • Don't worry about whether people read your work. Writing is first and foremost a process for clarifying your own thinking. Readership is a bonus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtr6d0zb9s4xsqgz3w16dc))
- For example, turn writing into a game: 
  • How young of a reader can I successfully convey my nuanced argument to?
  • How many unnecessary words can I delete?
  • How much of a page-turner can I make this?
  • How much higher can I push my feedback score out of 10?
  • How beautiful can I make my prose? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqtsfxh4hwm01nzt94s4h42))
- I read for insights. And no writer can generate profound insights on a fixed schedule. I aggregate writers who publish sporadically. When they post, they truly have something to say. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqttfwf8peb3py3mxmtm7d6))
- The difference between good writers and bad writers is good writers know when their writing is bad.

- What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.
