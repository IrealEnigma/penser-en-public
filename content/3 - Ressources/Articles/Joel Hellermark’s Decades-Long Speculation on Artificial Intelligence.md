- Full Title: Joel Hellermark’s Decades-Long Speculation on Artificial Intelligence
- Category: #articles
- Summary: Joel Hellermark was only 19 when he started Sana, an AI-powered knowledge platform he describes as the ”Google for companies”. Today, at 26, the Swedish 
entrepreneur runs a 3 billion SEK company that is expanding to London and New York. As artificial intelligence enters a new arms race, with Microsoft and Google battling for pole position, the question remains: can Sana compete with Big Tech?

## Highlights
- There are two major problems we’re trying to solve. The first is that institutional knowledge today is scattered across dozens of systems. It’s stuck in presentations, docs, PDFs, and Slack threads. The second problem is that knowledge is trapped in people’s heads. These two problems are slowing teams down and wasting precious time.

- To capture a company’s knowledge, we first have to index it. Our platform does this by connecting to all the apps a company uses. Think: Drive, Slack, Notion. Once these apps are connected to Sana, we can use AI to help every single employee find exactly what they need. This is where the search bar comes in. Say an employee needs a reminder of the company’s latest OKRs. All they need to do is type that question, and Sana will search through all of the content inside all of those apps and provide a relevant answer in natural language. This is how we capture the knowledge that’s already documented. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk2t1rd62nxmrrfk046542z))
- To capture all the knowledge trapped in people’s heads, we need to make it really easy and enjoyable for people to pass on what they know. This is what our editor is for. You can use it to create anything from a quick doc to a formal learning course to an interactive live session. And the AI assistant is there to help you create an outline, brainstorm ideas, summarize your paragraphs, and more. If you decide to create a live group session, you can host that directly in Sana too—the video experience is built in. By offering all of this in one platform, we can accelerate a company’s ability to onboard new talent, ramp up sales teams, develop their leaders, and much more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk2vh9e4byfy9rgd6h02j4f))
- The original question was: how can we apply machine learning to human learning. We’ve developed models that can gain a much more fundamental understanding of human language. That understanding enables us to create more personalised learning experiences than ever before. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk2x5qbt7cb19dgm5s67mek))
- The thesis was that you could move from a medium where everyone consumes the exact same information in the exact same way to a medium where the content was dynamic based on what you already know, based on what you need to know, and how to teach you that most effectively ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk36c42d5bp9b246g6wstrm))
- I was really interested in the idea of augmenting human intelligence. Back in the ’80s, there were two leading schools of thought, led by Douglas Hofstadter and Marvin Minsky. One school was the notion of artificial intelligence, where we would effectively replace human intelligence with AI. The other was augmenting human intelligence. During a 1950s encounter at MIT, Marvin Minsky, declared: ”We’re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to make them conscious!” To which Douglas Engelbart reportedly replied: ”You’re going to do all that for the machines? What are you going to do for the people?”. I was really obsessed with Douglas’ notion of how we could augment humans to do things that extend their capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk39xg2gkby1gj5kd90cz8j))
- Buckminster Fuller. I was fascinated by his idea of ­meta-problems. Meta-problems were problems, that if you solved them, had cascade effects. In other words, if you solved those problems, you would solve everything else. Apparently, Fuller and Einstein went for a walk one day, and concluded that knowledge and education were the greatest meta-problems. If you advanced that, you advance everything else.

- When you go back in history, back to the printing press, or the Library of Alexandria, or whenever we’ve changed how people share and consume knowledge, that has had ripple effects across the whole of humanit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk3cr5pnbph5992ryhxb2dx))
- Throughout my childhood, I was curious about a lot of different areas. I didn’t want to pick one discipline. Instead, I wanted keep these interdisciplinary interests and combining my love for neuroscience with design, machine learning, and company building ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk3ed5f0f451bprecgtqgwf))
- What’s interesting about Sana is that it wasn’t really founded on a business idea. I wanted to build a place like Bell Labs, where we would gather the best scientists, designers, engineers, and marketers, and we would find intersections across all of these disciplines and build a generation of new tools that could empower people to learn more effectively. I wanted to work on machine learning. I wanted to work on human learning. That was really the beginning for Sana, much more so than that we had a specific idea.

- It was designed to be my life’s work, something that I could spend decades on. That’s why I think everything lines up so much towards it because it was very much a function of my interests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk3gf0mt3y3q2qbw8rwrz1z))
- Now, the models are reaching the right level. Learning and knowledge have never been a bigger problem for society, due to the half-life of skills reaching three years. We need efficient systems at scale to help us acquire new knowledge. Things are definitely lined up to realise that vision.

- I started Sana in the final year. My plan was to start university after the summer. Then we received our seed funding from Sophia Bendz. I knew that I eventually would want to build something like Sana, and I was fortunate to get started early. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbk3kvvb86mjh5frh4g7bycr))
- Take for example how AI helps you create content. Where should it appear? How exactly should it assist you? How do we make sure that it doesn’t get in the way? You want these experiences to be naively obvious. You shouldn’t even notice them. They should just be there, augmenting you and supporting you in your flow.
