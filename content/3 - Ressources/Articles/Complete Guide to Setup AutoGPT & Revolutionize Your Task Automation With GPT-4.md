## Highlights
- Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source project that allows you to define a specific role (e.g., “book market analyst”) and a bunch of goals (e.g., “research the most successful sci-fi novels of 2022”, “summarize them”, “save the summary to a file," etc.) and let [GPT-4](https://medium.com/tales-of-tomorrow/gpt4-has-arrived-everything-you-need-to-know-now-81bccb3fede1) automatically create and perform all the necessary tasks that are needed to achieve your goals. That includes:
  • doing research via search engines
  • browse websites
  • scrape data
  • store files locally
  • using long-term memory
  • spawning new instances of GPT-3.5 bots with special roles to accomplish sub-tasks (!)
  *(No worries, if you don’t have access to* [*GPT-4*](https://medium.com/tales-of-tomorrow/gpt4-has-arrived-everything-you-need-to-know-now-81bccb3fede1) *you can also run it with your GPT-3.5 API keys)*
  The results you get are mind-blowing.
  AutoGPT is an experimental project, that is, it has its bugs and flaws, especially when faced with new and not-so-common roles and goal descriptions, but it’s already a tremendous showcase of GPT-4’s capabilities and the potential of a modular approach to combine multiple AI agents.
