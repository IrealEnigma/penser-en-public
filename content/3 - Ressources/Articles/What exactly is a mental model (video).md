## Highlights
- **So, what actually is a mental model??** 
  Defining "mental model" is a little tricky because it's such an abstract concept with many different expressions. 
  Rather than say one definition is correct, I think each different definition of a mental model gives us a deeper understanding. Here are some of my favorite definitions:
  • “Representations in the mind of real or imaginary situations.” - Lesswrong
  • “Mental models are psychological representations of real, hypothetical, or imaginary situations.” - Princeton Mental Models And Reasoning Department
  • “Representation that describes how reality is (as it is known today) – a principle, an idea, basic concepts, something that works or not – that I have in my head that helps me know what to do or not. Something that has stood the test of time.” - Peter Bevelin
  • "A mental model is an explanation of how something works. It is a concept, framework, or worldview that you carry around in your mind to help you interpret the world and understand the relationship between things. Mental models are deeply held beliefs about how the world works." - James Clear
  • "The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system." - The American computer engineer J. W. Forrester
  Finally, this video from Shane Parrish of Farnam Street is the best video explanation of mental models on the web ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pkpqk9pg686n0thekrbdsd))
- Content shock is real! Social media content doubles every year. Digital information increases tenfold every five years. Academic research doubles every nine years. 
  Throughout all of human history, we thought that abundance was the cure to our scarcity ills, but it turns out that abundance can be just as pernicious as scarcity. Some of our largest challenges are caused by things like the abundance of credit, content, entertainment, options, products, etc. So, what’s the consequence of this great abundance?

- To master mental models (or anything for that matter) requires the same mastery process:
  1. Identify the fundamental components.
  2. Practice those components over and over until you have mastery.
  3. Learn to seamlessly combine components together until it's automatic.
  4. Learn to use the mental models in ALL of the areas of your life where they're relevant in the moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pndewb1cq4rt7e2e2nye6m))
- It's worth noting that there are two schools of thought when it comes to mental models: academic and professional. 
  **Academic:** Mental models have been studied academically since the 1940s. In fact, if you search Google Scholar for "mental model," you'll see nearly 200,000 different studies that use the term. The Mental Model Theory of reasoning argues that using mental models unconsciously is fundamental to how the brain itself reasons. In other words, the brain automatically creates mental models of the world. Then, when we go through life, we filter our understanding of what's happening through the mental models in our head. In this sense, becoming better with mental models isn't about starting from scratch and collecting models. It's about going from an unconscious and automatic usage of mental models to one that is deliberate about curation, improvement, and usage of mental models.

  **Professional:** The main popularizer of mental models in the professional world is self-made billionaire investor and entrepreneur Charlie Munger. To my knowledge, he first started talking about mental models in the early 1990s. Munger's approach to mental models is focused on curation and everyday application.

- Deutsch goes on to give an example, “All buildings stand on the same theoretical foundation; namely the laws of physics and the laws of engineering and architecture. And so, architecture therefore ultimately shares the same foundations, via physics, with such apparently very different fields as pharmacology, let’s say, which is indirectly related to physics via biochemistry and chemistry.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pn8hxfa9a122zcdnw04ske))
- That makes sense? Knowledge grows like a tree. It starts of with one trunk. That trunk then has many branches, which then has many branches, which then has many branches, and so on. So when Charlie Munger or David Deutsch say that they focus on the fundamentals, they're saying that they focus on trunks rather than twigs. This way, no matter how big the tree ultimately grows, by focusing on a trunk, you're building up a base of durable knowledge that will help you understand each twig across the entire tree.
