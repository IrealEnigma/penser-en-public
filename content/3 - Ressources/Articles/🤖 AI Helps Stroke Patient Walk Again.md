## Highlights
- **The Rundown:** Google rolled out new AI capabilities for Search Generative Experience (SGE) to enhance learning and help users digest complex information.
  **Key upgrades:**
  â€¢ â€˜SGE while browsingâ€™ now summarizes key points and answers from web pages â€” not just within search.
  â€¢ Aims to help research complicated topics and speed up browsing while building on Google's existing AI-powered summaries.
  â€¢ Hover definitions let you preview terms within AI responses, and new color-coded snippets improve code readability.
  **Our thoughts:** As the gateway of information for billions, the search giant might just hold the ultimate key to unlocking true mass adoption.
