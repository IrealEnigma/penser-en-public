- When you write a first draft, you write it for yourself. When you rewrite it, you write it for everyone else.

- In general, you'll find ideas bubbling up from these places: 
  • **Hooks** — Answer the captivating questions raised in your intro.
  • **Experience** — Reflect on observations and anecdotes.
  • **Research** — Acquire knowledge.
  • **Experiments** — Run tests.
  • **Brainstorming** — Voice-record then transcribe your thoughts.
  • [**Mental models**](https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples) — Think critically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqdqk6v0fggmz0m3azn5yv))
- My approach is to focus on ideas that are **interesting** or **surprising**. These are the ingredients of novelty. Novelty is what keeps readers reading. They tend to be:
  • Counter-intuitive
  • Counter-narrative
  • Shock and awe
  • Elegant articulations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqeg27f7v4kvxk03tzz0gk))
- When ideas stop flowing, ask yourself: 
  1. How can I make this point more convincing?
  2. What are the interesting implications of what I just said? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqfpb9319e2b8wq20325vm))
- First, share a poignant takeaway
  Identify your article’s significance by re-reading it and asking, “What was this really about? What was I trying to say?” 
  Distill the answer into a single, punchy sentence. Make readers think, “Ahh, yes, that's why this article was profound.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqhr67hmedtyzqhtcmb2tq))
- Next, provide next steps
  Now that your wisdom has resonated with readers, ask yourself, What about the world can my readers better appreciate now that they've read my article? 
  Share where they can go next to continue the journey they started here. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqjdqyydz0fxazex3ewrsy))
- Here's how those steps fit into our overall writing process: 
  1. Choose a topic
  2. Write your intro, and use it to brainstorm talking points
  3. Get feedback on your intro
  4. Create an outline using your objective
  5. Explore talking points within your outline
  6. Rewrite for clarity, succinctness, and intrigue **← The next page covers this**
  7. Cycle between rewriting, resting, and receiving feedback
  8. Copy edit for grammar, word choice, and style ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqkddc2k6msqzxyfsqv1by))
