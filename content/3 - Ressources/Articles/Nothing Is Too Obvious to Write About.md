## Highlights
- Hedonic adaptation — or how shiny things become dull
  Hedonic adaptation (also called the hedonic treadmill) is the curious fact that we keep believing that the next big thing in our lives is going to make us happy — even though we’ve repeatedly been proven wrong about that.

  Maybe that idea you were considering is not only trivial, but someone else has already written about it. What’s more, maybe a thousand people have already written about it — or even a million. And maybe I have written about it too. Does that mean you shouldn’t write about it?
