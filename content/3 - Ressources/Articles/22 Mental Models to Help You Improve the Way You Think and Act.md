## Highlights
- Serendipity
  Serendipity is the idea that good things happen by chance. This mental model encourages us to embrace chance encounters and keep an open mind, as you never know what opportunities may arise. Life is unpredictable, but sometimes the best things happen when you least expect them.
  For example, you may meet someone who becomes a valuable business partner or stumble upon an interesting article that changes your perspective on life. Being open to serendipitous events can increase the chances of making lucky discoveries and experiencing positive outcomes.

- Feedback Loops
  A feedback loop is a process where a change in a system generates more change. This mental model can be applied to many areas, from business to personal development. For example, a positive feedback loop in a business might be where a new product is successful and generates more sales, generating more profits and resources for developing new products.
  By understanding feedback loops, you can take advantage of them to create positive change in your life. For example, you may start exercising regularly, which leads to improved health, which leads to increased energy, which in turn leads to more exercise. You can create a virtuous growth cycle and improvement by creating positive feedback loops. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qh2evb9581zez8wfhhzc0x))
