## Highlights
- The most important skill anybody can learn is the ability to learn rare and useful skills on-demand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcn8sz3ye7y518rnw64k7r7))
- The reasons are simple:
  • To succeed over our entire career, we’ll need to learn dozens of new skills.
  • The most in-demand and high-paying skills of the future have not yet been created, because the world is so [rapidly changing](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/google-director-of-engineering-this-is-how-fast-the-world-will-change-in-ten-years-6f1e653b5374).
  • Therefore, it is impossible to fully front load our learning at the beginning of our career.
  • The people who learn hard, in-demand skills *first* will have the most successful careers . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcn9bngjba99cmrevnt1vke))
- **Given the changes on the horizon, you would think that learning how to learn would be taught in every school and baked into the corporate culture of every company. It isn’t.**
  In fact, the opposite is true. Not only is learning how to learn not taught, our popular culture is filled with dangerous learning myths that sabotage people’s success and cause them to waste countless hours learning mediocre skills they don’t remember for more than a few weeks and never apply.

- *“There are three principal means of acquiring knowledge: observation of nature, reflection, and experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of that combination.”*
  *— Philosopher Denis Diderot* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcpft9sfqqqxdqgtaktyhds))
- *If you are investing in your education and you are learning, you should do that as early as you possibly can, because then it will have time to compound over the longest period. And that* ***the things you do learn and invest in should be knowledge that is cumulative, so that the knowledge builds on itself.*** *So instead of learning something that might become obsolete tomorrow, like some particular type of software [that no one even uses two years later], choose things that will make you smarter in 10 or 20 years.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcpmttrpvrp5t68tseeyagt))
- One of the most famous sayings in Silicon Valley is that no business plan survives first contact with the customer. No matter how smart or experienced an entrepreneur is, there is always a gap between what they think the customer will buy or use and what they actually do.

- To my knowledge, no one in the world of knowledge work has mastered using the small learning loop more than self-made billionaire investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist [Ray Dalio](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/self-made-billionaire-there-are-three-levels-of-reality-and-most-people-are-stuck-in-level-one-ad5a1bf5ad76).

- • **Reflect once every ten minutes while learning.** This forces you to organize and contextualize what you’ve learned and not go into passive mode.
  • **Take a small action immediately.** When you have an idea to take an action, you have a 5-second window of motivation that you should leverage. The longer you wait, the less likely it is that you will take any action. This is known as the 5-Second Rule and was coined by Mel Robbins.
  • **Aim to get better every time.** Add time at the end of every discrete experience throughout your day to think about what you could have learned better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcpyrzdk5pa7ze2kz7r1dqt))
- **Learn fundamental mental models so your knowledge compounds** and doesn’t become outdated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcpztnf2826mrw12vmahky0))
- **Shrink your learning loops so you can iterate faster** and adapt to any change in your environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcq07v8htnd13fw6wx8agta))
- Address fixed mindset and limiting emotions at each stage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdcq19r4452s1hqb15vrw39x))
