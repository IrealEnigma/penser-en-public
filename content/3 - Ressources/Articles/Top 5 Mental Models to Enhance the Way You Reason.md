## Highlights
- The why model
  There is this great book by British/American author Simon Sinek called “[Start with Why](http://amzn.to/2raiBfc).” Its premise is that leaders who want to inspire action need to make sure that their message is communicated in a precise and well-articulated manner.

- I decided to go with inversion for two reasons:
  1. Thinking backwards is oftentimes more helpful in deconstructing a problem than thinking forwards.
  2. Pondering the ultimate consequences of a specific course of action can eventually make you more grounded and calm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q1gad22mak8gr1pjq4pgpe))
- **1. Thinking backwards is oftentimes more helpful in deconstructing a problem than thinking forwards.**
  The simplest way to understand this sentence is to think that, usually, instead of aiming towards abstract happiness, it is better to ensure that we will minimize misery.
  ***Example:*** You have a small business or a lean startup and you want to increase your revenue by 50% within the second year of operation. You plan and make projections and try to apply an aggressive strategy to meet your goal. New entrepreneurs, because they get carried away by their ambition and unrealistic expectations of their idea, frequently miss their goals and end up hopeless and frustrated.

These actions add a level of security to your plan and help you capitalize on this security in order to gradually make bolder decisions.

  I mentioned in my [anti-motivation manifesto](https://thequintessentialmind.com/the-anti-motivation-manifesto/) that what I admire the most about Elon Musk is his pragmatism. Most people get star-struck by his boldness and audacity, but few really recognize that the substrate that fosters boldness and audacity is pragmatism.
  When you accept the chances of your success, even if those chances are 10%, you position yourself in a more grounded and serene plane.
  Subsequently, when you try to carefully identify the parameters that may increase the chances of success and reduce the chances of failure, your ability to deal with them becomes more confident.
  I oftentimes get very stressed because I overestimate my capacity to deal with complexity and multitasking. I soothe myself with meditation and by reminding myself that the worst thing that will happen is to end my endeavor and start a new one.
