## Highlights
- **1. Have an idea book**
  Do you know the main reason most people can’t write daily?
  Because when they finally take time out from their busy schedule, they spend it all on ideation and not on actual writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0m9q6qyk4qv34sggetedhz))
- Skip this vicious cycle by jotting down 10 ideas for articles every day. Regularly create detailed outlines for 2 of these ideas. You don’t need a physical journal for this. Simply start on the note-taking app on your phone or computer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0m9s27effpfr5q188ssfcw))
- The goal is to have a space to collect all your ideas and outlines. This way, when you set your heart to writing, you won’t have to start from scratch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0ma29knjkmd0t7p0spt6db))
- **2. Plan for the upcoming week over the weekend**
  As a full-time employee, I craved weekends. That was the time to refuel my burnt-out engines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0mbmj5px4c7z3wj1a2y73v))
- I picked out 7 topics from my idea book to work on throughout the coming week.
  Picture this: I had to choose 7 ideas out of 70 (collected over the last week). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0mc5wmrycbhvj2xdapmm47))
- **4. Don’t wait for inspiration**
  This is one tip I wish someone told me when I started writing daily with a full-time job.
  When you’re functioning on a time crunch, you don’t have the luxury to wait for hours for inspiration to strike.
  If you’ve already fixed a time slot to write, get in front of your screen at that hour. You have these 2 hours, and you have to complete an article.
  Even though you’re thoroughly uninspired, glance at the outline and start writing. Yes, force yourself. Your intro won’t feel right. It’s okay. Keep typing mechanically.
  **The flow state hits after the first 200 words.** You’ll get into a writing flow as the words naturally start pouring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0mf0yjw074n94vak8m2cd4))
- **5. Have a publishing schedule**
  I almost didn’t mention this: I didn’t publish the article I wrote on the same day. I kept a repository of publish-ready articles.
  This is how you can make a functioning content publishing model:
  • Complete a 1000-word article in 2 hours, then let it sit for the night.
  • Before you start writing the next day, pull out your previous day’s work and edit and proofread it. Leave it for the night again.
  • On the next day (2 days after writing), give your article a final read and hit publish.
  These steps can sound like a lot of work, but they can make your process simpler and more efficient. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0mgmr4zaphcepj8vw8nb6q))
- To build a habit of writing daily, I swear by these 5 practices:
  1. Keep an idea book to note down ideas every day.
  2. Utilize weekends to have your next week planned.
  3. Have a dedicated time slot to write.
  4. Don’t wait for inspiration to start writing.
  5. Follow a publishing schedule for daily posting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0mhgze0d54tr9ajbm8qz26))
