## Highlights
- So below are some things that, while I try not to *regret,* I do wish I had done differently or sooner or better. I think you might benefit from doing them sooner too…

- There are many books I regret powering through, far fewer that I regret quitting. Life is too short to put up with bad writing — bad anything really. If the food sucks, don’t finish it. If the speaker is boring, get up and leave. If the party is no fun, go home. Stop powering through crap. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8h00wgdgzz4g89mwt0vf6z4))
