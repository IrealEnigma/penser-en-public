## Highlights
- Be unreasonable enough to ask for more than you deserve
  This is a cheat code to the Matrix world we live in.
  Learn to ask for stuff that’s not included because everything in life is negotiable and open to interpretation.
  • Ask a business if you can have a discount.
  • Ask your boss if you can do a better job as a trial.
  • Ask for pay raises and bonuses when they’re not due.
  • Ask [successful people](https://medium.com/illumination/while-everyone-is-watching-netflix-successful-people-adopt-the-2-mindset-8bd22400be3a) if you can take them out for lunch ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf0msgpdr01sa53mnbcs66))
- The worst that can happen is a person says no. So what. Say thank you and move on. A “No” isn’t a death wish or curse. It’s a reply. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf111x2eck9yzyvcc7x2n9))
- Optimize for freedom instead of money ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf2qdt215y27r6fm3cq5sb))
- One crucial step in this process was to ask myself these three questions:
  • Will this purchase make me money?
  • Will buying this give me more time with my daughter or less?
  • Will this purchase get me closer to [early retirement](https://timdenning.com/retire-early/) or further away? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf3kqrkba8ghfqam1r3s5w))
- There are natural ways to get a hit of dopamine, though. One way is to read and write. When you do, it helps you see patterns. And pattern recognition gives you access to natural dopamine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf4g7kjqjw8dmqphq2zdcz))
- There’s a good way to measure if the dopamine you’re getting is good or bad. Ask this question: “Did this activity help me progress in life?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf4tmdf8nmr12efjs7pd4h))
- If not, it’s probably the modern devil of cheap dopamine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf51hc31bgmdh76p25q4b9))
- Rest as hard as you work
  The sigma grindset mindset is a virus. Yes, you need to work hard but here’s what I’ve learned:
  Rest as hard as you work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf6d32qtc463aagex0d8sw))
- A tired mind is a useless mind. A person who never stops to enjoy life will see it pass by and have regrets. There are no awards for hard work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf6st167nwretcs8110ptc))
- There are big prizes, though, for people who do things in life and have experiences. Interesting people are a result of their experiences.
  The best rest is sleep. The second best is mindfulness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf77nvwrbycetd8sxp3et2))
- Become a curator
  Originality is overrated.
  It’s hard to be original and it’s unlikely you’re a genius like Einstein. Instead, try to become a curator of ideas.
  Find the best ideas online then share them. Take existing ideas and remix or blend them together with other ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf85fhgcv14m01v9fj7wam))
- Planning is what many people do for their entire lives.
  They never get around to “doing” though. What holds us back is the idea that an action has to be perfect or A-grade. The challenge with planning is results are unpredictable.
  You’re better off running small experiments in your life to see what works for you, than trying to overthink ways to have the perfect action take place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazf9b66nfq3pbg5c6c2ddjt))
- Embrace this default state
  There’s nothing worse than busy people.
  Dan Koe [says](https://thedankoe.com/letters/a-full-guide-to-reinvent-your-life-in-6-12-months/) “Chaos is our default state.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazfa9hrqh2bmpkhxn3nycpk))
- That’s why saying you’re busy, overwhelmed, or the time isn’t right are all useless excuses. If life is chaos then there will never be calm moments where it feels comfortable to change your life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazfads47nknd5z2py3mhksq))
- Embrace the chaos. Act in the middle of chaos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazfagkazkq2rwetfqmdv8yt))
- Innovation lies at the intersection of industries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazfbh2fc0zzwk3y1ngyfvwh))
- Do something good for the local community
  All of us live in a local community of some sort.
  For years I’ve ignored mine. I’ve rarely spoken to neighbors or had the guts to socialize at a town planning event. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazfe31za37x02jdmvm36s4z))
- This has led to invites to social events, opportunities for my kiddo to meet other children, and to feel more connected to the place I live. Do one interesting thing in your community. See where it leads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazfedb6bv86bm1tgh7r8ctb))
- Make your desk a blank canvas
  A messy desk leads to a messy mind.
  In the digital age there is no excuse for a messy desk. Most things should be stored digitally. Clean your desk to refresh your mind.
  A clear mind is a mind ready for growth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazffgj0sdtgr4ydxjcb39gv))
