- Summary: The ultimate goal of writing online is to build a Personal Monopoly, which is your unique intersection of skills, interests, and personality traits where you can be known as the best thinker on a topic. The Internet rewards differentiation, but it also makes it hard to create one due to competition. Your Personal Monopoly should reflect your innate interests, not what you think the world wants. Listen to the world as you publish. If your Personal Monopoly isn’t immediately obvious, double down on the ideas that captivate you, the compliments people give you, and the projects you enjoy working on.
