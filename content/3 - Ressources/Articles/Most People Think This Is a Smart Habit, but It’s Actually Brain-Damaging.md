## Highlights
- The junk learning epidemic meets those two qualities in spades. It also explains why we’re all experiencing the same symptoms:
  Symptom #1: False Learning
  We read “interesting” things that make us feel like we’re learning, but don’t actually improve our lives. This often happens because the information we consume:
  • Becomes very quickly outdated
  • Isn’t actually true or helpful
  • Isn’t actually applied to our life
  As a result, we waste years of our life consuming information thinking we are improving our life when we’re not. It’s like eating a kale salad every day for your entire life thinking it’s helping you, and then realizing that it was actually bad for you.
  Symptom #2: Memory Loss
  Over the last few years, I’ve taught learning how to learn to thousands of students and personally coached hundreds. One of the top questions I get asked is, “How can I remember more of what I read?”
  If you’ve ever read something interesting or useful, but have trouble recalling key parts a few days later, you know what I’m talking about.
  It’s almost like having amnesia. Once again, time is wasted.
  Symptom #3: Information Overwhelm and FOMO
  We use the word information overwhelm to describe one general feeling, but there are actual several root causes. We are overwhelmed by…
  • Distracting content unrelated to anything important to us.
  • Interesting content we’d love to consume, but don’t have time for.
  • Surface-level content without a connection to deeper mental models. (Like having a closet without clothes hangers.)
  This feeling of constant overwhelm makes us feel anxious, guilty, and leads to decision fatigue.
  Symptom #4: Addiction and Constant Distraction
  We’re at a turning point when it comes to phone and Internet addiction. Nowadays, most people realize that it is an actual thing. Additionally, it is quite difficult, if not impossible, to make the case that checking for news articles, emails, and social media 100+ times per day is productive.

  Symptom #5: Reality Dementia

  Counterintuitively, the more information we consume online, the more distorted our model of reality typically becomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wa1bbrm75v79j64q0me212))
- Real, quality learning has two characteristics:
  • **Real Learning Delivers Real-World Results.** What we learn should have a practical, positive result in our lives and the world around us. The standard for being smarter should not be feeling smarter — just like the standard for human connection shouldn’t be likes and comments, nor the standard for productivity simply crossing off items on your to-do list. Adding a “results filter” immediately reveals entertainment masquerading as information — what I call infotainment.
  • **Real Learning Delivers The Most Value.** Because there is so much information in the world and so little time, we have to make tough choices about what we learn. A decision to learn one thing is a decision NOT to learn a million other things. Furthermore, some information is 1,000x more valuable than other information. Therefore, our focus should be on the MOST VALUABLE information, not SOMEWHAT VALUABLE information. The difference between *some* value and *most* value is night and day.

- **When you consume infotainment, you’re saying no to breakthrough knowledge.**
  Imagine you have two people:
  • One person primarily consumes a diet of infotainment/junk learning.
  • The other primarily consumes a diet of breakthrough knowledge.
  As time goes by, the first person will be better at family trivia nights. The second person will have a dramatically more successful, fulfilling, and impactful life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wam8mrcwc3x4gzh9h3daw4))
- “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.” — Alvin Toffler ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wancmcb1c9yq1c1m5vv8a7))
    - Note: Okay, this is mind blowing
- There is no way that anybody interested in real learning would design a system like the one we have. Instead, the approach would be fundamentally different. It would have four crucial components that…
  • Define what the “most valuable” information is (i.e., the superfood of learning).
  • Show how to find that superfood.
  • Help you reflect and apply that information to your life.
  • And most importantly, deliver important real-world results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7warzjrsbgm679bk2jq52jb))
- This system would be active and deliberate rather than unconscious and passive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wasgvjsv2wd3bk81rf5xpw))
- 1. First, everyone would have a framework that defines what the most valuable information in the world is — the superfood of learning.
  After all, If you don’t know what you’re actually looking for, then any info will do. I call this super-valuable info the “superfood” of learning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7watar3pf9scgnrm0nfacfy))
- For example, let’s say I wanted to learn from investor, author, and researcher Nassim Taleb. Which strategy would be most efficient?
  • **Junk Learning Approach:** Follow him on social media and log into your newsfeed multiple times per day to see if he has any updates. Comment, like, or share if you feel inspired by any of his posts.
  • **Superfood Learning Approach:** Consider all of his writing over his career and identify the most valuable knowledge to start with. This would likely lead to starting with one of his books, which he spent years researching, writing and refining. It would also lead to rereading it, taking detailed notes, and methodically applying it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7waxfx2nfe1yfjzz0nb0796))
- 3. Next, everyone would automatically and systematically reflect and act upon the “superfood.”
  > *“Understanding does not depend on knowing a lot of facts as such, but on having the right concepts, explanations and theories.” — physicist David Deutsch*
  The default approach to junk learning is to do nothing after consuming information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wayh2t9jmbpy4wpxcztrgv))
- **Learning is NOT just about taking in information.** Looking at text and expecting to learn is not far off from looking at food and expecting to get its nutrients. We need to digest our life experiences just like we digest our food. Without some form of active processing, almost everything we read is lost within weeks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wb5vf6jwxqs8y09wgsxan7))
- 4. Finally, everyone would experience life-changing results.
  > *“When intelligent people read, they ask themselves a simple question: What do I plan to do with this information?”* ― Ryan Holiday ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wb8avxt2mq46yjj9vb2fd3))
- And this is the **most important point**.
  Learning shouldn’t be measured by whether or not it makes you feel smarter.
  And, it shouldn’t be measured solely by action.
  It should be measured by whether it actually creates results in your life that are important to you over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wbg5daxsjzkrav9wpwy2dm))
- • **The “experts” are not actually experts.** Either they’re successful because of luck, not because of skill. Or, they’re pretending to be more successful than they actually are.
  • **The “experts” are not good teachers.** As we become more and more expert in any domain, we gain the ability to automatically perform at a world-class level. The cost of this automaticity is that we forget the basic building blocks that make up our skills. This makes us a worse teacher and is known as the curse of knowledge.
  • **The “experts” have ok advice, but not great advice.** Unfortunately, the difference between good advice and great advice is night and day. The difference between a good result and a great result can be 100x. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wbnx7bdte78qn9m5rh9xka))
- Below are the criteria we used…
  1. **They have had a huge impact on the world.** I wanted to learn from role models, people that inspired me to make a dent in the universe with my short time on this planet… Founders who started with nothing and made something that improved other people’s lives or used their earnings to improve other people’s lives.
  2. **They have a multi-decade track record of career success.** With the passage of time, markets go up and down. Environments and paradigms change. By focusing on people with a long track record, I removed people who were merely in the right place at the right time at a single point in their life.
  3. **They have spent 5+ hours a week on deliberate learning throughout their career.** In other words, they value knowledge extremely highly. Despite being so busy and having thousands of the world’s smartest people working for them, they still made time to learn.
  4. **They are serial, self-made billionaires….** not all billionaires are worth learning from, and money in itself is neither good nor bad … but I have found that studying people who built incredible wealth from the ground up, more than once, without having inherited it, tend to be some of the most resourceful and innovative people on the planet and have some of the best models for career success.
  5. **They have extensively shared their lessons with the world.** I narrowed down the list to people who have written books, have been interviewed extensively, or shared their thoughts publicly in other ways. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wd6m8gdt4ekx7w5anncsdh))
- narrowed down the list of 2,000 Luminary Learners in the world to approximately 50 luminaries like:
  • **Bill Gates** (founder of Microsoft, richest person in the world for decades)
  • **Jeff Bezos** (founder of Amazon, richest man in the world)
  • **Elon Musk** (founder of PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX)
  • **Oprah Winfrey** (#1 talk show host in history)
  • **Charlie Munger** (partner at Berkshire Hathaway)
  • **Reed Hastings** (founder of Netflix)
  • **Ray Dalio** (founder of Bridgewater Associates, largest hedge fund in the world)
  • **Judith Faulkner** (founder of Epic Systems)
  • **Marc Andreessen** (founder of the Netscape, world’s first Internet browser)
  • **Steve Jobs** (founder of Apple)
  • **Sarah Blakely** (founder of Spanx)
  • **Jack Ma** (founder of Alibaba)
  • **Thomas Edison** (most successful inventor in US history)
  • **Folorunsho Alakija** (woman billionaire based in Africa)
  • **Peter Thiel** (founder of PayPal)
  • **Drew Houston** (founder of Dropbox)
  • **Patrick Collison** (founder of Stripe)
  • **Tory Burch** (founder of Tory Burch)
  **I call these serial, self-made billionaires “Luminary Learners.”**
  Naturally, these Luminary Learners share common traits you’d find in any self-development book — hard work, thinking big, overcoming obstacles, setting goals, etc.
  But, as I spent more time studying these Luminary Learners , I noticed something peculiar — something they all have in common, that no one seems to have written about before…
  The #1 “SuperFood” Of Learning, According To This Small, Quirky Group Of Luminary Learners
  When they talk, it’s almost as if they’re speaking a different language.
  Just look at [this interview](https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_future_we_re_building_and_boring) where Elon Musk describes how he thinks:
  *“I look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities. It’s like a branching stream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing. I may introduce something new to the probability stream.”*
  Unusual, right?
  [One writer who interviewed Musk](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) describes his mental process like this:
  *“Musk sees people as computers, and he sees his brain software as the most important product he owns — and since there aren’t companies out there designing brain software, he designed his own, beta tests it every day, and makes constant updates.”*
  Musk’s top priority is designing the software in his brain. Have you ever heard anyone else describe their life that way?
  Luminary Learner Ray Dalio is no less “weird.” In his book, *Principles*, he describes how he thinks: *“Nature is a machine. The family is a machine. The life cycle is like a machine.”*
  Dalio’s company, the largest hedge fund in the world, records every conversation (meeting or phone call) inside the company and has built several custom apps that allow any employee to evaluate any other employee in real time. The data is then added to profiles that each employee can see and is subsequently fed into an artificial intelligence system that helps employees make better decisions.
  Dalio also [describes his day](https://fs.blog/ray-dalio/) in much different terms than you would expect from a CEO:
  *“I’m very much stepping back. I’m much more likely to go to what I describe as a higher level. There’s the blizzard that everyone is normally in, and that’s where they’re caught with all of these things coming at them. And I prefer to go above the blizzard and just organize.”*
  Charlie Munger uses a “cognitive bias checklist” before making investment decisions to ensure he properly [applies the correct mental models](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/how-one-life-hack-from-a-self-made-billionaire-leads-to-exceptional-success-a0b21fc34048). Warren Buffett uses [decision trees](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/8-things-that-self-made-billionaires-do-differently-26399196feb3). Jeff Bezos thinks of Amazon as being at Day One even though it’s been around more than 20 years.
  **Over time, I’ve come to realize that the reason these Luminary Learners talk differently is because they think differently.** In other words, they have “thinking tools” — ways of using their brain, which we can all learn from — so that we become smarter, more successful, and more impactful ourselves.
  Interestingly, even though these Luminary Learners are all unique, there is a surprising consistency in how they think. They share certain mental models on the world that are unique and rare.
  And because of the explosion of media, we can all see inside their minds for the first time. We can do the equivalent of spending hundreds of hours with them side-by-side as their virtual “cognitive” apprentice.
  And that’s what I did…
  How I Learned To Think Like The World’s Smartest “Luminary Learners”
  The more I studied the thinking tools of these Luminary Learners, the more I naturally started to use them in my life and business outside of writing, and the better results I got. This was a game-changer for me.
  The results I was getting weren’t just a little better. This wasn’t a little 5% or 10% change. It wasn’t even a 100% improvement. This was 10x, and in some cases 100x. It was a big deal.
  Here’s the transformation I experienced…
  I saw reality on a much deeper level — and on a fundamentally different level. I looked back on many of my old mistakes, and thought to myself, “Oh my God! If I had only known this or that mental model…” I wasn’t just learning new strategies or hacks.
  On some level, I could relate to some of my favorite movie characters just after their intelligence had exploded…
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:334/0*SfDOmcDNS1DZy3l6)
  **First, I saved over one hundred thousand dollars…**
  For example, 12 years ago, I borrowed $100,000 from friends, vendors, and banks (at high interest rates) to keep a struggling website I created alive. Rather than facing obvious indicators that the idea wasn’t working, I kept on doubling down. I was in love with my idea, and I didn’t want to admit defeat. The company died a slow, painful death.
  Now that I understand mental models, I see how a bad mental model — “sunk cost fallacy” — caused my poor decision-making.
  Today when I consider new business ideas, instead of just imagining how great they’re going to be, I also envision what could go wrong — a good mental model — saving a lot of my time and money upfront. For example, a few months ago I had the idea to create a book summary of the month club where I would write a weekly in-depth summary of a life-changing book. I got really excited about it and spent 10 hours thinking about how great it was going to be. A few days of planning later, I decided to take a step back and honestly assess the downsides. Almost immediately, I started seeing some glaring roadblocks, and the new shiny object was no longer as exciting. Soon after, I decided to just focus on our core businesses. I’m very happy that we did. Twelve years ago I would have jumped in straight away.
  **Also, our article virality shot through the roof…**
  The success of our business is directly related to the number of views each article gets. So, being able to get hundreds of thousands of visitors per month without paying for ads is a big deal.
  After learning about the 80/20 Rule (which is now one of my favorite mental models), I started asking the most successful article writers what the 20% activities were that give them 80% of the results. Almost all of them mentioned that titles were key. Previously, I viewed the titles as just an afterthought.
  Because of this insight, my team and I restructured our entire article creation process:
  • Now, we create titles before we write articles.
  • Rather than spending 5 minutes on titles per article, we dedicate 5–10 hours per article.
  • For every article, we brainstorm over 30 titles rather than a handful.
  • We test the article titles before we publish them.
  Our team has now spent over 1,000 hours studying the patterns of titles and testing nearly 5, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wd60ct42gbmgeqsvf2gqf6))
