## Highlights
- **The Anchoring bias**
  The anchoring bias is your tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making a decision. This can lead to suboptimal choices as important considerations may be ignored. If you are shopping for a car and the first dealership you visit quotes a high price, you may anchor to that price and be less likely to negotiate at other dealerships. Research has shown that the anchoring bias can have a significant impact on decision making, with people making decisions that are up to 25% worse when anchored to irrelevant information.

- **The framing effect**
  The framing effect refers to the way in which the same information can be presented in different ways, leading to different decisions being made. For example, consider a medical treatment or clinical trial that has a 90% success rate. If the treatment is framed as having a 10% failure rate, it may seem less appealing than if it is framed as having a 90% success rate. The framing effect can have a strong influence on decision making, with people being up to three times more likely to choose one option over another depending on how it is framed.

- **The sunk cost fallacy**
  The sunk cost fallacy will result in you continuing investing time, money, or other resources into something due to the perceived ‚Äúsunk‚Äù costs that have already been invested. This can lead to poor decision making as it ignores the opportunity cost of alternative investments. If you have already spent a significant amount of money on a concert ticket, you may be more likely to attend even if you are not enjoying the show, due to the sunk cost of the ticket. The sunk cost fallacy can lead to the continuation of unprofitable or unsuccessful projects due to a reluctance to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù the resources already invested.

- **The status quo bias**
  The status quo bias refers the habit of sticking with the current situation or default option due to a perceived cost or effort in making a change. For example, you may continue to invest in a certain mutual fund due to the perceived hassle of switching to a new investment option, even if a more profitable option is available. Or, you may get stuck with your current job situation if you are not willing to have an honest conversation with your boss about the expected goals, outcomes and next steps. The status quo bias can lead to missed opportunities as people may be unwilling to consider alternatives to their current situation.

- **The halo effect**
  The halo effect refers to the tendency to allow one positive attribute to influence our overall perception of a person or situation. This can lead to biased decision making as it ignores other important considerations. If a job candidate is attractive and well-dressed, they may be perceived as more competent overall and be more likely to be hired. The halo effect can have a significant impact on decision making, with people being up to three times more likely to choose one option over another based on a single positive attribute.
