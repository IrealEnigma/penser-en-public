- Summary: Without realizing it, we all use mental models. When you’re thinking of product/market fit, you’re using one. When you believe in the value of money, you’re using one. When you’re avoiding a mental bias by logically thinking through a problem, you’re using one. In its widest definition, any theory that helps you understand something is […]

## Highlights
- Without realizing it, we all use mental models. When you’re thinking of *product/market fit*, you’re using one. When you believe in the value of money, you’re using one. When you’re avoiding a mental bias by logically thinking through a problem, you’re using one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pnp9s3hseq9h6e41fqkq4w))
- They define them as “apps for your mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pnpmm4fhcwve7ctp8s17gd))
- In today’s marketplace, the smartest companies aren’t those that necessarily out-produce the competition. Instead, it’s the organizations that outthink them.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pnrc0026ppx5zqcghzdy9c))
- Ironically, we first need a model to understand mental models. Imagine them as a toolkit: you need to pick the right tool for the right problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pnsbj9412rpb8hm27h8ngs))
- Act like an intellectual carpenter: you need as many relevant tools in your toolkit as possible. Let’s look at a few useful ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pnxeep1eykyc1dshb3bnnp))
- One model that is highly suitable for making better decisions is the *Circle of Competence*. It [has been attributed](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/12/mental-model-circle-of-competence/) to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and can be summed up as follows:
  1. Understand where you have expertise, knowledge, and skills.
  2. Understand where you don’t.
  3. Operate in the areas where you do, stay away from the areas where you don’t.
  4. Slowly expand your areas of competence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pp0d829r4r6kshgfs4t2p0))
- This might sound obvious, but many of us don’t *know* what we don’t know. This is the danger zone where big mistakes happen, especially in decision making. Being aware of what you do *not* know will help you avoid stupidity. It can be the trigger for going to look for outside advice, or to avoid a decision altogether.

- Ask yourself the following three questions to determine if your marketing should also focus on changing your customer’s mental models:
  1. Do they fail to see a problem that seems obvious to you?
  2. Do people recognize the problem, but fail to see how your solution could solve their problem?
  3. Do people recognize the problem, and the value of your solution, but fail to make the change? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pp5h2m8n2sgm3cm8tvgt78))
- **Implementation in daily life** 
  Reading about mental models in an article like this is one thing, actually using them in daily life quite another. You need to build your toolkit, remember to use it when the right moment arises, and then you also need to keep adding new tools.
  This process can be captured in four essential steps:
  1. Read
  2. Store
  3. Connect
  4. Trigger ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8ppadcm54kb839r6tfxc3h3))
- You build your toolkit through **reading**. In fact, the wider you read, the better. As blogger and author James Clear writes in [his article](http://jamesclear.com/feynman-mental-models) about Richard Feynman:
  > *“If you develop a bigger toolbox of mental models, you’ll improve your ability to solve problems because you’ll have more options for getting to the right answer. This is one of the primary ways that truly brilliant people separate themselves from the masses of smart individuals out there.”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8pp9xdcp7ctdsk99ska6xt1))
- But reading alone doesn’t get you there. Unless you have an amazing memory, you’ll need to be able to **store** your mental models somewhere. I use digital note-taking tool Evernote for this purpose, but you can also use a physical notebook, or even go for a meticulously organized [notecard system](https://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/).
  It’s also important to understand how different mental models relate to each other. You need to **connect** them to see their relations. This helps you apply the right model at the right time. This is one reason why I prefer a digital system over a physical one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8ppgz5vrv05djbyrh56ra1y))
- The last crucial step is to have a **trigger**, something that reminds us to actually apply the models we have stored.
  Mental models are useful when the stakes are high, when we’re faced with important decisions, deadlines, and other types of pressure. Under these circumstances we often fall back into our old habits. Without some kind of reminder, we completely forget about the trove of models we’ve stored in our toolbox when we need them most.
