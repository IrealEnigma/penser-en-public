## Highlights
- 1. Have as few tools as possible in your digital life
  The more tools you have, the more complex you’re making things for yourself, and the less efficient you will be. Keep your framework simple and focus on getting things done rather than always looking for the next tool and the next upgrade.
  2. More tools don’t mean more productivity
  On top of creating complexity, having too many tools creates what I call “information volatility”. Bits of knowledge get stored here and there, but at the end of the day nothing is connected, and information gets lost. Having a big knowledge database is useless if it is not interconnected. The more you can gather your data in one single place in your digital life, the more you’ll be able to get the most out of it, whether it’s meeting notes, research papers, or a business plan.

    - Note: Surtout aujourd'hui, avec la publication massive de nouveaux outils IA, toutes les semaines. Il faut faire le tri, choisir les bons outils.
- 3. Knowledge networking is the future of content creation and research
  The difficulty of keeping everything centralized and organized is directly proportional to the rate of technological progress. 10 years from now, there will be a gazillion more tools, with as many opportunities to get sidetracked and “break” your database. The future of work is connected and information-centric. The products and companies that will succeed will be the ones that offer the most compatibility and connectivity between different apps and combine everything under one platform.
