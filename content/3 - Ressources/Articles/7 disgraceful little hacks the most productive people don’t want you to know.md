## Highlights
- 1. All-day movement.
  Starting the day in the gym is great for lifting those energy levels and staying fit, but those who take it a step further find ways to move throughout the day.
  They may take several walks.
  They take breaks with a few pushups thrown in.
  Maybe they’ve installed a pull-up bar in their home office or do the sexy snake dance to loosen those hips between zoom calls. Productive nutters are always moving.

  And here’s another cheeky thing about obsession — you don’t wait for the inspiration to strike.
  You must first decide to be obsessed and bring relentless energy and attention to the object of your desire.
  This is beautiful because with a decision comes an eruption of energy and excitement that will surprise you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haza8wdcd7ak1z6yn8ee946g))
