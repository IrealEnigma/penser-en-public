- Summary: "How To Take Smart Notes" by Ahrens introduces a revolutionary approach to note-taking and writing, emphasizing the importance of creating a structured system to enhance thinking and learning. By externalizing thoughts through notes, individuals can build a network of interconnected ideas that can be drawn upon for creative work and personal growth. The book advocates for writing as a medium of thinking and highlights the significance of organizing notes by context rather than topic to facilitate the writing process. Through standardized note-taking and a streamlined workflow, the book guides readers on how to extract, connect, and develop ideas effectively to unleash their full creative potential.

- Luhmann realized that a note was only as valuable as its *context* – its network of associations, relationships, and connections to other information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcnad6sz8256bqara1ps6zt))
- By creating notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann anticipated hypertext and URLs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcnjyhmz3dtbjdjq2hy0nme))
- If you want to learn and remember something long-term, you have to write it down. If you want to understand an idea, you have to translate it into your own words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcnpyd4hgsfcf75s0e76hyg))
- Deliberate practice is the best way to get better at anything, and in this case, you are deliberately practicing the most fundamental skill of all: thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcntfsyqkthrmyjrc0cng8y))
- It is easy to think we understand a concept until we try to put it in our own words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcnyevr37e62a7g36remrrn))
- “When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcp1njctxbwkpqjwxwpagmy))
- Students in most educational institutions are not encouraged to independently build a network of connections between different kinds of information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcp5fs35wm9srzdvr3htga5))
- We build the same connections in our heads as we deliberately develop them in our slip-box. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcp6c19k0nce3ref6tjqtvv))
- Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcp8gm3mj4zctc00q9d8t6y))
- Ahrens offers four guidelines in creating literature notes:
  1. Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep
  2. Keep the overall note as short as possible
  3. Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim
  4. Write down the bibliographic details on the source ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcpbc1xxkxppxac0k3fpdpx))
