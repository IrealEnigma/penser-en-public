## Highlights
- Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist who is well known for his contributions in the field of understanding personalities, studying the unconscious mind and looking at psychology from a more analytical point of view. According to him, every person has a unique personality that is shaped by the experiences they have in their life — this personality is also affected by their interactions from the outside world and also their unconscious thoughts.

- However, Jung also believed that other than a self personality, there is also a collective unconscious that threads all humans. The key to find one’s true self is to explore both — individual and collective unconscious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazbrdc4exkvb35jvythckz7))
- There are 4 types of archetypes
  1. The Persona:
  It is how we present ourselves to the world. The word “persona” is derived from a Latin word that literally means “mask.” It represents how we act around people, how we shield our emotions, talk to people and change our behaviours. According to Jung, the persona may appear in dreams and take different forms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazbrs8keea9wnvhb3rkxdm7))
- 2. The Shadow
  The shadow is an archetype that consists of the sex and life instincts. It exists as part of the unconscious mind and is composed of repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts, and shortcomings. This form is a result of trying to fit in the cultural norms and become more acceptable by society. It is this archetype that contains all of the things that are unacceptable not only to society, but also to one’s own personal morals and values. It might include things such as envy, hate, and aggression etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazbrxmx9ehsn0d4m1c8rs9s))
- 3. The anima/animus
  Anima is a feminine image in the male psyche, and the animus is a male image in the female psyche.
  This represents the “true self” rather than the image we present to others and serves as a source of communication with the collective unconscious.
  Jung believed that physiological changes as well as social influences contributed to the development of sex roles. These archetypal images are based upon both what is found in the collective and personal unconscious. The collective unconscious may contain notions about how women should behave while personal experience with wives, girlfriends, sisters, and mothers contribute to more personal images of women.

- 4. The self
  This is an archetype that represents the unified unconsciousness and consciousness of an individual. Jung often represented the self as a circle, square, or mandala. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazbtqczxhrsp0k4vyv9fy2d))
