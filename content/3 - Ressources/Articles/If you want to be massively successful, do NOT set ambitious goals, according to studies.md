## Highlights
- **Downside #1: Goal obsession can lead to being unlucky**
  One of the best examples of how goals can lead to myopia is a famous study conducted by UK researcher Richard Wiseman.
  [In this study](https://amzn.to/2SbnNMK), Wiseman gave people who considered themselves lucky and unlucky a newspaper and then asked them to look through it and count the number of photos inside.
  Here are the average results of how long it took people:
  **Unlucky people:** 2 minutes
  **Lucky people:** seconds
  How was this even possible? On the second page, there was a huge half-page ad that said:
  > “Stop counting. There are 43 photographs in this newspaper.”
  Amazed by the results, in his next experiment Wiseman placed a second large message halfway through the newspaper:
  > “Stop counting. Tell the experimenter you have seen this and win £250.”
  Once again, the unlucky people missed the message. They were too busy counting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7we0pn81zkznxm86cnvxbd0))
- **Downside #2: Achieving goals can leave you feeling empty**
  > “The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.” —Yuval Noah Harari ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7we3am3swtyhkd1be0vzjz4))
- The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him the most about humanity, he said, “Man. Because he sacrifices in health in order to make money. Then, he sacrifices money to recuperate his health, and then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present. The result being that he does not live in the present or the future. He lives as if he is never going to die, and then he dies having never really lived.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7we24fgzdbgzh0akyr5skcw))
- We’ve all had this experience of going after empty goals. We think a goal is going to change everything, so we sacrifice our health or our close relationships (or both) for it. [Then, in the end, we realize that what we sacrificed may have been more important than the goal itself](https://medium.com/the-mission/if-you-dont-want-to-regret-your-life-30-years-later-make-this-one-choice-right-now-1cc137516df0).

- In my twenties, I had a goal to build a business with over $1 million in revenue. Our team referred to it as the two commas goal. When we achieved it, nothing really changed, and I wondered why we had put so much energy to achieving this goal as rapidly as we could.

- **Downside #3: The second you set a goal it starts to become stale**
  > *“The reason that most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals, not for the person we’re going to be when we reach them, but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them.” — Jim Coudal*
  Two things happen after you set a goal:
  • You change
  • The world changes
  Yet, when we set a goal, we often unconsciously make the assumption that we *won’t* change significantly and neither will the world. Neither is true.
  If we set a 10-year goal to go down a certain path, the person we are in five years [may actually feel trapped by it](https://medium.com/the-mission/an-ambitious-persons-take-on-work-life-balance-i-almost-lost-hope-in-my-marriage-b6f0c0355c2). There is such a large sunk cost of time, money, and energy. We have publicly committed to it. Many of the people we have built relationships with still value the goal. As a result, it’s hard to give up.
  Furthermore, we will be confronted with new opportunities in the future we can’t even imagine now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7we86pk034xxg62ah6ncx2x))
- When I set the million dollar revenue goal, I framed the goal, and hung it in the closet so I could see it every morning when I got dressed. Year after year, I full heartedly pursued the goal. The more I missed it, the more I felt insecure, like I was doing something wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7weap0ytrmf4t7z635yvrr5))
- **Downside #5: Goals can reduce learning**
  When it relates to learning, [several studies](http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/22%20-%20Seijts%20&%20Latham%20AME%202005.pdf) have shown that setting performance goals can backfire.
  For example, when someone sets a goal to get an A in school, they may end up studying for the test rather than studying to learn. As a result, performance goals can hurt learning goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wec3kcr9eqj19qw5re4n6h))
- Ultimately, the six main downsides of goals are:
  1. Goal obsession can lead to being unlucky
  2. Achieving goals can leave you feeling empty
  3. The second you set a goal it starts to become stale
  4. Goals can make you feel insecure
  5. Goals can reduce learning
  6. Goals can actually make you feel unmotivated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wek47gyt6xwq5rvtac91fg))
- **[Ambitious] objectives actually become obstacles towards more exciting achievements,** like those involving discovery, creativity, invention, or innovation — or even achieving true happiness. In other words (and here is the paradox), the greatest achievements become less likely when they are made objectives. Not only that, but this paradox leads to a very strange conclusion — if the paradox is really true then the best way to achieve greatness, the truest path to “blue sky” discovery or to fulfill boundless ambition, **is to have no objective at all.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7weppg8ef9ybp5fvjz2h9ng))
- The 3 Keys To The Stepping Stone Model
  > **“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”**

- #1: Novelty is a great shortcut for detecting great stepping stones ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wevn94mce02gynwbyqj3ea))
- When you’re a beginner at something, you can get novelty easily via simple trial & error. For examples, let’s say you’ve *never* read a book on habits before. As a result, it’s likely that the first book you read on it is going to be mind-blowing even if it is mediocre.
  As you become more expert on habits though, novelty becomes harder to find. Trial and error is no longer enough. You need to change how you think. You need a more complex model. For example, after you’ve read 10 books on habits, rather than picking up an 11th book on habit change, you may need to search in another discipline you know nothing about and then see if it provides creative ideas you can apply back to habits.

- “A lot of people who spend a long time trying to figure out how to solve tough problems in one industry don’t ask, ‘Well, is there some way we could apply that solution to a different industry? And that can be really, really powerful.” — Elon Musk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wevhw09vrnefvs8m1tp9f6))
- **#2: Humans are uniquely good at perceiving novelty**
  > *“Behind any serendipitous discovery there’s nearly always an open-minded thinker with a strong gut feeling for what plan will yield the most interesting results.”*
  > 
  > *— Kenneth Stanley and Joel Lehman* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wey97sx4qkcmj8wjg9az46))
- Furthermore, Stanley and Lehman have found that replicating this natural human ability to identify paths that are *interesting* is currently impossible with artificial intelligence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wez4t909znevc61p6sh0fy))
- Often we feel the urge to explore a particular path or idea despite being unsure where it might lead. Our intuitions and hunches often prod us in directions that might not be justified objectively but still lead to something different or interesting. So it’s no coincidence that the concept of interestingness comes up naturally when discussing novelty. When an idea feels genuinely novel, that’s often enough to make us curious. The idea interests us even if its ultimate purpose is unclear… **We understand that if we take the interesting path, it may yet lead somewhere important, even though we might not know where.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wf012j4hc9fkkdx9zy7zq2))
- This is how babies go from zero knowledge of the world to incredible amounts of learning — simply by following their curiosity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wf3a8x8q76r814bk18sbjc))
- Am I so fascinated by this that I’d be willing to spend serious effort learning more? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wf6d8pr9nghzr6s9h9wgna))
- If the answer is NOT [hell yeah](https://sivers.org/hellyeah), then let it go. If it is a hell yeah, then make time for it within your schedule with the [5-Hour Rule](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-5-hour-rule-if-youre-not-spending-5-hours-per-week-learning-you-re-being-irresponsible-791c3f18f5e6). Use the level of your fascination as a compass. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wf71nmkz9ckynkjenzpq7z))
- This filter is powerful on two levels:
  1. **How much you’re willing to sacrifice your time for a fascination is a good proxy for how fascinated you actually are.** This proxy helps protect against shallow curiosity where you’re pulled in by clickbait titles, notifications, and subject lines that feel interesting in the moment, but don’t actually matter.
  2. **Having a high bar for fascination prevents information overwhelm.** The more you get in touch with your innate curiosity, the more and deeper curiosities you will have. The “hell yeah” filter prevents you going int too many directions at once. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wfa3fjzxkcwz3tkbf36qz6))
