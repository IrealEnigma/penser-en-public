- Summary: In "The Real Price of Success," the author reflects on the lives of successful individuals and the sacrifices they made to achieve their goals. They emphasize the importance of considering both the "list price" and the "real price" of success. The list price refers to the direct effort and hard work required, while the real price includes the hidden tradeoffs and opportunity costs of pursuing a goal. The author encourages readers to ask themselves three questions: what is the list price, what is the real price, and are they willing to pay it. They emphasize the need for clarity and self-awareness when deciding what price they are willing to pay for success.

## Highlights
- I was recently re-reading [Titan](https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303), the biography of infamous businessman, John D. Rockefeller, when I was struck by a realization:
  The people I read books about are very rarely the people I would ever want to trade lives with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsvc149831ykgh3dnj0e7y))
- Extraordinary success has a price (a very steep one at that). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsvp0wzxrfbdcm8q9sfzwa))
- List Price vs. Real Price
  In a basic sense, our lives are shaped by three factors:
  1. The things we want: Financial success, healthy relationships, physical and mental health, etc.
  2. The price of those things: The obvious and non-obvious inputs required to buy or earn those outputs.
  3. The willingness to pay those prices: Whether we are willing to pay the price to buy or earn those things we want, or if we try to go "bargain hunting" for cheaper alternatives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsv4b4r6n59qbbvbfcm9hf))
- There is a price tag for anything you want to achieve in life. Every single thing you want is an *output* that requires certain *inputs* to buy or earn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsw218j67n7b37d88v7khk))
- Importantly, there's a "list price" and a "real price":
  • List Price: The actual, direct price to pay for the thing you want. The effort, hard work, discipline, and energy required to buy or earn that thing.
  • Real Price: The List Price, plus the hidden, indirect price in the form of the tradeoffs and opportunity cost of the pursuit. The Real Price incorporates the price of the things you said "no" to by saying "yes" to this one thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsw7tt6z6pkgn38jqgc789))
- What I've learned: There are many things in life that look like a great deal based on the List Price, but a ripoff based on the Real Price. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbswmw5t9x212tdvvbkqwyw))
- The 3 Questions to Ask Yourself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbswqxna46pq8bx9tdnm2v3))
- #1: What is the List Price for the thing I want to achieve? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbswssy5f9qebg34m1c4ebh))
- If the List Price is based on the way that things have always been done, is there a better way? In other words, [what would this look like if it were easy](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/unlocking-leverage-comfort-vs-truth-more)?

- #2: What is the Real Price for the thing I want to achieve? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsx7sd1kgn8cjtsdrabg8r))
- What am I saying no to by saying yes to this? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsxcaf8nrfzv5t92ja2786))
- What events am I going to miss? What relationships will have to take a backseat? What aspects of my health will fall out of view? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsy1q39v63z4syq0gamtkx))
- Be honest in answering these questions—it's the only way to enter a new pursuit with clarity on what you intend to pay, and avoid the creeping price tag that slowly increases and makes it so difficult to walk away (due to the sunk cost fallacy).

- Also note that the Real Price will change based on the "seasons" of your life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbsytx3bfzgst42bkb872xb))
- #3: Am I willing to pay the Real Price?
  Now that you're aware of the Real Price of the thing you want:
  Am I willing to pay it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbszf2fmkn4yvnn3zamj2xn))
- The Price We're Willing to Pay
  For me, thinking clearly about the List Price and the Real Price of the things I want has helped create a balanced existence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbt037vckzc3yq361gh5g3c))
- I spent most of my life thinking that I wanted to build something enormous, be extraordinarily rich or famous, and have some large buildings named after me.
  But while the world certainly needs some people to continue thinking like that, as I've matured, I've realized that the Real Price of those things is not one that I'm willing to pay (at least not for now). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hhbt1f2wq1p3pekke66j383q))
- In a different season of my life, perhaps I will reconsider my view on the Real Price, but for now, I'm thrilled to enjoy my pool days and leave the building of something enormous to one of my amazingly ambitious readers!
