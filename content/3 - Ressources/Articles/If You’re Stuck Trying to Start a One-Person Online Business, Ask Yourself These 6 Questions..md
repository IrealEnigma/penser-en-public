- Here’s how I started:
  • I started by asking 2–3 contacts if they had any social impact-related projects they needed support with.
  • I identified their challenge and the gap from where they currently are to where they want to be.
  • I provided advice on how I could help get them there and the skills and experience I’ve had to demonstrate credibility.
  • I won the contracts. And boom. My business was started. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8gzcqca5dq6y3tz0ev9vqrs))

- When I did this exercise I got:
  • Making money as a content creator.

- Back to marriage.
  People plan for a bright future, but they don’t plan for a messy divorce.
  I had a lot of fears about starting my business.

- To overcome this fear, I used Tim Ferriss's Fear-Based Goal Setting.
  **Column 1 Define**: List all your fears. Be specific and detailed. Rate your fear out of 10. With 1 being minor, and 10 being catastrophic for your life.
  **Column 2 Prevent:** Bad events don’t happen overnight, so plan some mitigating steps you can take to prevent the worst case scenario from happening.
  **Column 3 Repair:** Create a plan of action if those fears came to life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8gzjtqsz7bj4m21qvxkd3rg))
