## Highlights
- **C.O.D.E (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express)**
  In the book, Forte outlines a system for outlining the methodology: C.O.D.E (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express).
  In the Capture phase, I have three main sources: an RSS feeder that automatically captures content from various sites (e.g. Thoughtworks Technology Radar, Stack Overflow Blog), Goodreads and Readwise integration that gets all the highlights from books I’ve read, and notes from myself.
  In the Organize phase, I use a note-taking app (I use Obsidian) to collate and categorize all of the content I’ve captured in the previous stage. This helps me to make connections between different ideas and start to see patterns emerge. There several note-taking apps that are popular in the market but I use Obsidian because of how easy it is for me to integrate with other sources. There are much easier note taking apps to use like Notion but unsure how well you can extend to integrate with other applications
  The Distill phase is where I try to write down my thoughts on each of these ideas in a more permanent format. For this, I use a simple text file and Roam research. Roam research is an amazing tool that allows you to link your notes together in a non-linear way, which has been invaluable for making connections between ideas.
  The final stage is Express, which completely optional is when I share my thoughts with the world via this blog or other channels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h756f5xbawaz9a77xs6gjted))
