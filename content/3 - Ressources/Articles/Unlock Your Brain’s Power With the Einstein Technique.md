## Highlights
- “Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.” — Einstein ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wfvd8qfgwmvsc0mprrgsf9))
- We see this same pattern in one of the bestselling authors of the 20th century, Napoleon Hill. In his book, [Think and Grow Rich](https://amzn.to/2JeFiej), which describes his 20-year study of the most successful people of his age — including Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison — he explains: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wgcgq4yv0gdxr54eff1gzk))
- “Every night, over a long period of years, I held an imaginary Council meeting with this group whom I called my ‘Invisible Counselors.’ The procedure was this. Just before going to sleep at night, I would shut my eyes, and see, in my imagination, this group of men seated with me around my Council Table. Here I had not only an opportunity to sit among those whom I considered to be great, but I actually dominated the group, by serving as the Chairman…. In these imaginary Council meetings I called on my Cabinet members for the knowledge I wished each to contribute, addressing myself to each member in audible words.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wgc8ccq0w0zhjzrn8qbjg9))
- The trick now is to make it conscious and deliberately improve it. You can do this with the Einstein Technique. Here are the steps…
  1. Consciously build a [mental model](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/this-is-exactly-how-you-should-train-yourself-to-be-smarter-infographic-86d0d42ad41c) of how your field actually works.
  2. Test the [mental model](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/this-is-exactly-how-you-should-train-yourself-to-be-smarter-infographic-86d0d42ad41c) in your mind by mentally stimulating different scenarios.
  3. Test the accuracy of your [mental model](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/this-is-exactly-how-you-should-train-yourself-to-be-smarter-infographic-86d0d42ad41c) in the real world.
  4. Repeat steps 1–3 with the lessons you learned in steps #2 and #3. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wgdd027e3jz55a4ag5y4ht))
- When I edit articles, for example, I consciously simulate how specific types of readers will feel as they are reading the article. I will read an article 15+ times and each time from a different perspective. Each read through gives me something new. I stop rereading the posts once the voice in the back of my head is silent as I read. Finally, I refine my own simulations by having 3–4 people read and give feedback on every article I write before I publish it. I further refine it by reader feedback. More specifically, I read all of my comments and see how people share the article on social media. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wgh977z5yqwv8hqmh6nbp6))
- There is an old saying that we only use 10 percent of our brain. This has been proven false in a literal sense. It’s not as 90 percent of our gray matter is lying dormant.
  But it may be true in a metaphorical sense. We have way more power than we give ourselves credit for. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wgmm9z4hpk672tr3k75xsa))
