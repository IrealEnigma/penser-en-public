- When you feel first notice the urge to procrastinate, pause, take a breath, and then repeat this to yourself:

  • Do you tend to procrastinate on paying your bills? Instead of paying them from your home office, take your tablet to the coffee shop and pay them there.
  • Maybe you frequently procrastinate going to the grocery store… Try shopping at Albertsons instead of Safeway for a month. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazahfzn5tjnxv9n14ae33r8))
