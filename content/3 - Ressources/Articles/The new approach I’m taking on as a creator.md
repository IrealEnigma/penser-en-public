## Highlights
- I’ll tell you a funn thing: With each published article, tweet or video you grow. Maybe you don’t grow your audience or your network, but you certainly grow *yourself*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb9hc2w902qfgnv979pfmszz))
- because writing gives him mental clarity and after writing he feels calm, compossed and organize. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb9hna8z18x5vsp98vfshnwb))
- I do it because I love writing, because it’s my therapy, it’s the way of organizing my thoughts, it’s a way of increasing confidence, it’s a way of connecting with great people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb9hn3m4h0y2a336q7wmsr7d))
- My previous approach:
  • Posting 3 tweets a day whatever it takes
  • Comment on big accounts 25 times a day
  • Check statistics every 2 hours
  • Write 4 articles a week
  • Use growth networks
  My new approach
  • Post 1 tweet a day (coming up with 1 interesting insight per day is no problem for me)
  • Commenting on my friends’ accounts and accounts that actually add value to my life
  • Check statistics max. 2x a day
  • Publish at least 1 article per week
  • Build genuine friendships with interesting people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb9hpvxmdg0bad9b4mm2rwq1))
