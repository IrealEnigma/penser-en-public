## Highlights
- A noisy Internet gives you an ‘excuse’ to create like a maniac.
  I see many people who get romantic about their content, choosing to focus solely on the quality of the work.
  They neglect the reality that it takes effort to cut through the noise. They put out two articles a month and wonder why nothing is happening. You’re either all-in or all-out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nwqd4mp9tg8g7r4eef9da))
- But rather than seeing it as a ‘chore,’ see it as an exciting opportunity to create like crazy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nx3y5q7b5eqdye8r64zf3))
- Creating is to express your humanity.
  The more you create, the more alive you feel. Humans are either in one of two modes: reactivity or creativity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nxdsn5wmffr3ff703crxh))
- To react is to resist reality and to lose parts of you in the process. To create is to do what you were built to do – to bring something new into existence. If there were a universal meaning to life, this would be it. To create is to affirm living. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nxvetnthehhq3va3r1a0a))
- When you see how creativity is not just an option but a necessity, you will have an empowered reason to do it every day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0ny376aa6ey9sv16z2kw64))
- You will quit if your expectations are high.
  When we expect things to be easier than they are, we are more likely to get disappointed and quit when things inevitably do not go to plan.
  You will have setbacks. No one will read your articles. People will criticise your work. You will experience frustration and self-doubt. But if you have low expectations, you will know that these are simply part of the experience of an active creator. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nyve4frcq8y15mwe47vfk))
- When you expect things to be hard, you will stay in the game, driving through your obstacles like a bulldozer. The most prolific creators are hardened warriors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nz4fssd9aykaq9ktdqa8y))
- Impact is made through repeated efforts.
  All the impact you want from your work, from creating clients to growing an audience, is born out of relentlessly and consistently sharing.
  Impact might look like an event, but the needle is moved only after you have shown up day after day before that point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nzpxsmay9f3a17rfd827a))
- Double down on your strengths.
  If you’re starting out, you want to experiment as much as possible.
  This is how you find what works and where your strengths lie.
  But once you are clear on what is working for you, whether it’s a thread that went viral or a youtube video with great engagement, you want to do more of what has been shown to work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0p0m5v3kssbdnqz4xaa3mj))
