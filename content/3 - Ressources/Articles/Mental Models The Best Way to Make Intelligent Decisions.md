## Highlights
- What Are Mental Models?
  Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.
  A mental model is simply a representation of how something works. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q2p77ree5btzvttp4hsy9t))
- **[1. The Map is Not the Territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/)** 
  The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists. This is important to keep in mind as we think through problems and make better decisions.

- **[2. Circle of Competence](https://fs.blog/2013/12/mental-model-circle-of-competence/)** 
  When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, we have blind spots. If you know what you understand, you know where you have an edge over others. When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve. Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes.

- **[3. First Principles Thinking](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)** 
  First-principles thinking is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated situations and unleash creative possibility. Sometimes called reasoning from first principles, it’s a tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. What remains are the essentials. If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.

- **[4. Thought Experiment](https://fs.blog/2017/06/thought-experiment-how-einstein-solved-difficult-problems/)** 
  Thought experiments can be defined as “devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things.” Many disciplines, such as philosophy and physics, make use of thought experiments to examine what can be known. In doing so, they can open up new avenues for inquiry and exploration. Thought experiments are powerful because they help us learn from our mistakes and avoid future ones. They let us take on the impossible, evaluate the potential consequences of our actions, and re-examine history to make better decisions. They can help us both figure out what we really want, and the best way to get there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q2s7g6q2ayytaxfwn972py))
- **[5. Second-Order Thinking](https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/)** 
  Almost everyone can anticipate the immediate results of their actions. This type of first-order thinking is easy and safe but it’s also a way to ensure you get the same results that everyone else gets. Second-order thinking is thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically. It requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well. Failing to consider the second and third order effects can unleash disaster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q2tzbwb93nszwrrrxnzd1q))
- **[6. Probabilistic Thinking](https://fs.blog/2018/05/probabilistic-thinking/)** 
  Probabilistic thinking is essentially trying to estimate, using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass. It is one of the best tools we have to improve the accuracy of our decisions. In a world where each moment is determined by an infinitely complex set of factors, probabilistic thinking helps us identify the most likely outcomes. When we know these our decisions can be more precise and effective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q2vec2pcg75dps2jnj1nek))
- **[7. Inversion](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/)** 
  Inversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is “invert,” which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point. Most of us tend to think one way about a problem: forward. Inversion allows us to flip the problem around and think backward. Sometimes it’s good to start at the beginning, but it can be more useful to start at the end.

- **2. [Reciprocity](https://fs.blog/reciprocity/)** 
  If I push on a wall, physics tells me that the wall pushes back with equivalent force. In a biological system, if one individual acts on another, the action will tend to be reciprocated in kind. And of course, human beings act with intense reciprocity demonstrated as wel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q2z887z8vvmmy5qnfk6gmy))
- **7.** [**Leverage**](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/leverage/) 
  Most of the engineering marvels of the world were accomplished with applied leverage. As famously stated by Archimedes, “Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world.” With a small amount of input force, we can make a great output force through leverage. Understanding where we can apply this model to the human world can be a source of great success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q311jm86p556c148tapjwx))
- **3. Ecosystems** 
  An ecosystem describes any group of organisms coexisting with the natural world. Most ecosystems show diverse forms of life taking on different approaches to survival, with such pressures leading to varying behavior. Social systems can be seen in the same light as the physical ecosystems and many of the same conclusions can be made. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q383hsw6d8afnkj948qjcj))
- **1. [Feedback Loops](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2011/10/mental-model-feedback-loops/)**  
  All complex systems are subject to positive and negative feedback loops whereby A causes B, which in turn influences A (and C), and so on – with higher-order effects frequently resulting from continual movement of the loop. In a homeostatic system, a change in A is often brought back into line by an opposite change in B to maintain the balance of the system, as with the temperature of the human body or the behavior of an organizational culture. Automatic feedback loops maintain a “static” environment unless and until an outside force changes the loop. A “runaway feedback loop” describes a situation in which the output of a reaction becomes its own catalyst (auto-catalysis) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q3c106z4r9cfqpfg0r840f))
- **4. Scale** 
  One of the most important principles of systems is that they are sensitive to scale. Properties (or behaviors) tend to change when you scale them up or down. In studying complex systems, we must always be roughly quantifying – in orders of magnitude, at least – the scale at which we are observing, analyzing, or predicting the system.

- **1. Opportunity Costs** 
  Doing one thing means not being able to do another. We live in a world of trade-offs, and the concept of opportunity cost rules all. Most aptly summarized as “there is no such thing as a free lunch.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q3hk0y1t3y22x984ctthc2))
- **2. Creative Destruction** 
  Coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter, the term “creative destruction” describes the capitalistic process at work in a functioning free-market system. Motivated by personal incentives (including but not limited to financial profit), entrepreneurs will push to best one another in a never-ending game of creative one-upmanship, in the process destroying old ideas and replacing them with newer technology. Beware getting left behind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8q3jz2nxpgdr3q3vcwy75fa))
- **3. Pavlovian Association** 
  Ivan Pavlov very effectively demonstrated that animals can respond not just to direct incentives but also to associated objects; remember the famous dogs salivating at the ring of a bell. Human beings are much the same and can feel positive and negative emotion towards intangible objects, with the emotion coming from past associations rather than direct effects.

- **5. [Tendency to Distort Due to Liking/Loving](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/09/mental-model-bias-from-liking-loving/) or [Disliking/Hating](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/09/bias-from-disliking-hating/)** 
  Based on past association, stereotyping, ideology, genetic influence, or direct experience, humans have a tendency to distort their thinking in favor of people or things that they like and against people or things they dislike. This tendency leads to overrating the things we like and underrating or broadly categorizing things we dislike, often missing crucial nuances in the process.
