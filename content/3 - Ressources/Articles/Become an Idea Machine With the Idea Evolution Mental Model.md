- Summary: Source: Full TED Talk (11 min) Video Summary In this TED Talk, Thomas Thwaites recounts the year he spent building a toaster from scratch. The effort is impressive. The results aren’t. But, through it all, he teaches a fundamental lesson that I haven’t forgotten in over a decade.

## Highlights
- This video beautifully demonstrates how dependent we are on humanity’s collective knowledge to build anything. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrems4y8x31epsq6jffaaq9c))
- And when product creators want to build something original, they start by building on top of what has been built before like, Thomas Edison: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hremsqn434fw6b9833v0rrdr))
- Since most aspiring thought leaders miss this, they don’t build on adjacent and historical insights. As a result, social media is flooded with mediocre hot takes of people thinking they are original when they’re not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hremtr7t8w9haar857sqsaqf))
- Many would-be thought leaders sit around and try to create big ideas by hoping for an extraordinary insight simply by writing out their thoughts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hremvjn5phxczzx3abhcy8gw))
- Ideas actually arrive through a process that is akin to evolution:
  • Collect lots of diverse knowledge units **(research)**
  • Mix and match those units **(thinking)**
  • Experiment to see which combos work **(testing)**
  • Package the best combos in interesting ways **(packaging)** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hremw21pvjz49sjw9vpr3y7e))
- **Implication:** The power of the idea evolution is backed up by tons of research and case studies (links in this article). And, when you apply it to your idea production process, it completely changes how you spend your time as a thought leader. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hremwky7cqaksxycwh71cp7y))
- • Research the best of what humanity has figured out so you can stand on the shoulders of giants
  • Collect diverse knowledge so you can make combinations no one else can
  • Build a memory system so you can automatically combine things in your head forever
  • Build a comprehensive notes system so you can cite quotes years later
  • Generate endless ideas via combinatorial creativity
  • Experiment with and then select ideas that can make your career
  • Package your ideas so they grab attention and spread virally ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hren016bsbpmv0rdrzar37e0))
