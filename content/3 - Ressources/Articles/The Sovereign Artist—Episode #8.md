- Think of all the people living in Tokyo, London, Dubai, New York, Miami, or Los Angeles. They have something “fun” to do available at all times. Are they ever able to spend time alone, in silence, meditating on random existential crises? Do they ever get bored? Do they ever find the time to waste their time?

- ut if you dislike small, quiet, human-scaled places—you’re simply disconnected from nature. We aren’t designed to live in big cities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqfzs7drs08gb9n3ykvyv7bv))

- How many of us choose to work because our ambition springs from a boundless desire to manifest ourselves spiritually? How many of us start projects, not strictly as a result of financial considerations, but because they are genuine expressions of who we want to be? Are you able to identify five true artists, scholars, philosophers, or scientists among us? Can you even name one polymath that’s not dead?

- The art of *wasting your time* doesn’t translate into intellectual laziness or eternal vagabonding. It’s about being open to wonder, adventure, miracle, and serendipity. It’s about being comfortable with uncertainty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqfzzfk93qd161v4w5shv01v))
