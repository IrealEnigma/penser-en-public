## Highlights
- A novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and *worthwhile*. I've identified five categories:
  • **Counter-intuitive** — "Oh, I never realized the world worked that way."
  • **Counter-narrative** — "Wow, that's not how I was told the world worked!"
  • **Shock and awe** — "That's crazy. I would have never believed it."
  • **Elegant articulations** — "Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself."
  • **Make someone feel seen** — "Yes! That's exactly how I feel!" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqps1fj5yceky85s8cdxv5n))
- Ideas resonate when they're wrapped in:
  • Stories
  • Analogies
  • Examples
  • Authentic voice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpsfpwmw2scgkfe6y33zx4))
- Writing Quality = Novelty x Resonance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpsmqz2rh3cv64ac83mcgy))
- Step two is pairing that objective with what **motivates** you: 
  1. Does writing this article get something off your chest?
  2. Does it help reason through a nagging, unsolved problem you have?
  3. Does it persuade others to do something you believe is important?
  4. Do you obsess over the topic and want others to geek out over it too? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqptj4k5jxzkm9d9qr6cf89))
- It doesn’t matter how you hook readers, so long as you eventually fulfill the hook. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpv7ep27vy1t1qr3gvr2qg))
- A hook is a *half*-told story. You raise a question then tease only part of the answer: 
  • **Questions** — Pose an intriguing question, but don’t give the full answer.
  • **Narratives** — Share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion.
  • **Research** — Highlight research findings, but only a small portion.
  • **Arguments** — Make an unexpected claim, but don't explain how it's true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpvxht12n5j2btxh3j766v))
- Asking a question isn't enough
  For a hook to resonate, readers must be given enough context to care about the rest of the story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpxatqs4wtds66e9n6mdn0))
- • Give readers a reason to care about our hook. **Connect** it to **meaningful** problems they face. (Failing to do this is where most intros go wrong.)
  • Hook readers with half of an interesting story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpxngf6ftjf30t73hyfvq6))
- • Ask yourself, “If someone else wrote my intro, what are the most captivating questions they could pose to make me excited to read this?”
  • Write those questions down. Even if you lack the answers.
  • Rank your questions by how much they interest you.
  • The top questions become your hooks: pose them in your intro, but don't reveal their answers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqpy9g4srwzxc5q5f04adxg))
- n your intro, consider proactively countering any major skepticisms that exist. There are five types of skepticism to counter: 
  • **Superficial**: Superficial skepticism emerges from readers not believing you’ll share things they don’t already know. 
  *Solution*: Tease your original insights in your introduction.**‍**
  • **Irrelevant**: Readers don’t believe you’ll cover key points they care about. 
  *Solution*: List the points you’ll cover.**‍**
  • **Sloppy**: Readers don’t want to sit through bad writing. 
  *Solution*: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.**‍**
  • **Implausible**: Readers don’t believe you’ll deliver on your hooks. 
  *Solution*: Include quotes from authorities who agree with you.
  • **Untrustworthy**: Readers don’t believe you're qualified to write about this. 
  *Solution*: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can't help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they believe you. Or, if you're indeed unqualified, be upfront about it and frame the post as an exploratory journey you're taking them on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqq2b0y8bayrw4116byeryn))
