## Highlights
- **The Blue Ocean Strategy is a powerful framework that can help early-stage startups and first-time entrepreneurs find uncontested market spaces** to create new demand and make the competition irrelevant.
  The strategy was first introduced by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne in their book “Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz6kjnb2gdynrnsft86ad31))
- By focusing on creating a new market space or “blue ocean”, companies can avoid competing in the same space as their competitors and instead create new demand for their products or services.
  The strategy consists of four key actions: eliminate, reduce, raise, and create. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz6ky0cnzw53vqa77gkswme))
- Eliminate
  This refers to **the process of identifying which factors that the industry takes for granted that your company could get rid of.** This helps create an entirely new market space and allows startups to reposition themselves in a way that challenges the status quo.
  For example, Uber eliminated the need to hail a cab on the street and instead allowed riders to book a car through their smartphone. By eliminating this friction point, Uber created a new market space and became a leader in the ridesharing industry. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz6m6z3w08d0b3hjmh9r275))
- Reduce
  This involves **identifying which factors the industry has overinvested in** and reducing them to an acceptable level, thus freeing up resources that can be used to create new value for customers.
  For example, Southwest Airlines reduced in-flight meals and other amenities to reduce costs and offer lower fares, which allowed the airline to gain market share from traditional carriers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz6m9p9cewtx83256bs31qg))
- Raise
  This involves identifying **which factors should be raised above industry standards** to create new demand. This is often achieved by identifying pain points that customers have with existing solutions and offering a more compelling alternative.
  For example, Apple raised the design standard for smartphones by creating the iPhone, which offered a user-friendly interface and sleek design that quickly became the industry standard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz6mc6jxxvxr69b3y8y2gj5))
- Create
  Find and **add factors the industry has never offered** and “create” them in your products to attract new customers. This involves finding unexplored market spaces and developing solutions that satisfy unmet customer needs.
  For example, Netflix created an entirely new market space by offering a subscription-based streaming service that disrupted the traditional model of purchasing or renting physical copies of movies and TV shows. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz6mfwjkht59a1vz7fmb4kd))
