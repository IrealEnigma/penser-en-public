  3. Ask — where you deliver by asking questions that lead people to your ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htpfdbh1hqjfnrvnn40maj4a))

- SPEAKING SKILL 1: Focus attention ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htvnz7aecktcsam8rp9zpsjr))

You have to input time, energy and thought in order to create a desired output, such as a blog, article or book. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htvp6772671ey9b1gj4c6a01))

- AUTHORSHIP SKILL 2: Maintain momentum Once you start writing, write regularly. There is a magic that occurs in writing when you get in the flow. Writing regularly tends to increase the frequency of writing in flow. Writing in flow, if you have never heard of or experienced it, feels as if you are simply taking dictation, as your thoughts or the universe or your genius provide the ideas and words, and your fingers write or type them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htvp90b7zhsmk1s83vtchp1g))

- COACHING SKILL 4: Maintain perspective As a coach it is important to keep your perspective outside the individual and the issue.

- SPEAKING ACTION 3: Deliver it to an invited group and/or to service clubs
  There is only one way to get better at speaking, and that’s to speak. Lots. So before you go to a speaking bureau or a conference organizer and ask for $5,000 to give your talk, deliver it to lower-risk audiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htwbzvmt9d6ne4bvcm8b3rgn))
- SPEAKING ACTION 4: Offer a low-investment preview or special-deal sessions to prospective clients Give your talk at a brown-bag lunch. Include it in a training package.

You need to be on top of all the significant books and journal articles in your area, and read these as a thought leader. Have two pads beside you as you read; keep one list of points that you can add to, and one of points that you disagree with. You want to be adding to the field, not just regurgitating it.

- AUTHORING ACTION 4: Write 1,000–1,500 words on one title Do this with a view to selling them to print media.
