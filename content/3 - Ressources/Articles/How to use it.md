## Highlights
- Brute force is limited to the amount of energy and time you have. Leverage is limitless and can work when you don’t.
  Effort leads to results. Leverage is able to make your effort go exponential. That means you get outsized results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98gr5tjx4afn3c4sj29gtsh))
- Archimedes said it best:
  > Give me a place to stand and a lever long enough and I shall move the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hb4ttbvb4xra9nwqn1gz0))
- An audience online gives you distribution. It’s how you reach people. And once you can reach enough people you no longer need to apply for jobs, buy ads, or ask for permission.
  It’s about access to humans — not follower counts, selfies and useless vanity metrics such as ‘likes.’

- Find a topic you can build a community around. Immerse yourself in it and learn about it every day. Document everything you learn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hc5gc36qawadr81thjjer))
- Audience leverage is the capturing of awareness. But you first need to create that awareness of who you are and what you have to offer the world.

- Leverage is a tool from ancient times.
  I’m obsessed with leverage because it’s how you get more of whatever you want in life. But it can be hard to explain leverage. Over the last 9 years I’ve collected the best descriptions. Once it makes sense then you can do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98gqjkrpcrk4wtn2kxp0e03))
- How to use it
  Digital leverage can be overwhelming.
  There’s a temptation to be everywhere all at once, and therefore, nowhere. Don’t fall into this trap. Choose one platform and one type of content (writing, audio, video, illustrations).
  Publish each day for at least a year. Watch your leverage skyrocket. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hdznpx9c47etm034d9n46))
- A system is a habit that’s backed by a repeatable system. You don’t have to think. You just do. The system provides automation which leads to spectacular leverage over time.
  The difference between a habit versus a system is that a system is documented. There are checklists and it’s simple enough that anyone can follow them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hekzxxmdedh1248mqsmja))
- Turn your passions into habits. Turn your [habits into systems](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/goals-without-systems-useless-39a47c837e6a). Document every part of the system so you can outsource parts of it later.
  *Outsourcing your systems leads to another form of leverage…* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hexnpggr9h4dvf4af1erd))
- Labor leverage is a fancy way of saying “Get humans to do the work so you don’t have to and are freed up to be creative.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hf892fh6z9wj6cqqk178c))
- Startups and entrepreneurship represent labor leverage, which business bros love to get off on and overemphasize. I have no interest in owning a 1000-person startup daycare. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hfgpcq58dxkqspt0axc9q))
- How to use it
  First, have systems so you can teach freelancers to do your tasks for you. Notion and Loom (screenshare software) will help you document them.
  Then hire your first freelancer for a one-off task (cap it at $100) and slowly get comfortable letting others do your work. The mindset shift of “Wow others can do this” provides huge leverage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hfvq4mw1azyjmkypwh81v))
- You are only as powerful as the people you know.
  My dad used to say “It’s not what you know but who you know.” That’s been true for me which is why I’m always proactively building my network.
  It started on LinkedIn then I repeated the process on Elon’s birdy app. Often it doesn’t involve sending cold DMs to strangers. No. It’s about contributing interesting ideas to existing online conversations.
  Over time people will remember you, then when you do DM them, they will respond and know your name. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hkdntq8nep5ykx8rd46f5))
- How to use it
  Leave 5–10 comments a day on posts you appreciate about a topic you love.
  After a few months start to DM your favorite people who you’ve engaged with. Don’t ask for anything.
  Just connect and mention something about them you appreciate. Ask “What are you currently working on?” then find a small way to help them or offer a bit of advice based on your experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hkg9ae3ks839yppwh1pm0))
- We all have experience and skills.
  The trouble is our default behavior is to use what we know to trade time for money. This means you end up with a lot of 1–1 relationships instead of one-to-many.
  One of the best things I ever did was productize my knowledge and experience into courses, digital downloads, templates, and eBooks. Now I don’t always need to be around to deliver value.
  Products scale your time beyond the 24 hours you have in a day.

- Use the previous steps to build distribution and audience. Then offer a course, digital download, template, or eBook to them. Start with a price so low people won’t say no. This will create a psychological shift in you.
  > $1 earned through leverage feels 100x better than $1 earned selling your time — [Eric Jorgenson](https://twitter.com/EricJorgenson/status/1310722562490597378) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hp09jtv90rr5h74qygvz3))
- There’s a powerful form of leverage hiding in plain sign: consistency.
  Many people never stick around long enough to get the result they’ve worked hard for. They lack patience or the mindset to keep going even when it gets tough.
  When you’re consistent you get extra rewards for no more effort because you become reliable, trustworthy, and visible.
  No one is going to invest in you when you haven’t executed on a goal for a consistent and reputable amount of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hr9b7xgj60js4fbwjyjq5))
- Find an obsession and get consistent. Set 5-year timeframes. If you’re really insane like me, think in decades.

- Money creates leverage because it’s a resource that can buy you more time and more labor leverage. Investing is a form of capital leverage.
  It’s where you invest money into a cash-generating asset. Over time your money makes more money. This big-ass problem of having to earn money then becomes smaller, so you can leverage your time to be more creative. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98hs32ed5d5mbbfzgf12q8f))
