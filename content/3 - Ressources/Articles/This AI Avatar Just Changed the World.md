## Highlights
- so at this point we've all seen the various talking head AI avatars most of us have
  probably played around with did and while that Tech is pretty solid there is very much a uncanny valleyness to it sort of a you know robotic nature well check this out this is wholly AI generated in 1947 at Harvard University real Admiral Grace Hopper was working on the Mark II computer one day the system stopped working and technicians discovered a moth trap between the contacts of a relay causing the malfunction it's pretty crazy right
  so that is Joshua you and the Avatar is generated via his company hey gen now hey Jen has been around for a bit according to crunchbase since November of 2020 which in AI terms is basically ancient and they have recently partnered with canva but what we saw was the new model so no need to go rush over to campus and start burning through credits and if you're doubtful about the validity of this well I signed up for the beta and you can too the link is down below and a couple of minutes later this popped in my inbox hi Tim thanks for your interest in our ultra realistic
  Avatar feature for your use case demo for a YouTube channel that covers AI Tech and creativity so that is either AI generated or someone is forcing Joshua to read these scripts based off of every beta application that comes in and we should probably start organizing a rescue mission additionally what's really impressive is according to Joshua this model only requires about two minutes of material to train on so I did want to take a closer look for some pros and cons here and I'm going to do something that I very rarely do which is I'm going to get super critical on this ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h857v236a25man56qmzwnnnf))
- it's kind of Comic-Con for or computer Graphics the best analogy I can come up with Nvidia dropped some pretty big news they've been very bullish on the AI space for quite some time and
  this seemed to be very much a payoff moment for them they showcased AI workbench which is designed to be a self-assembly kit for AI developers which comes pre-trained with a number of models and tools that can be easily customized thus Saving Time on development they also showcased Omniverse which is sort of their platform that will take anything from CAD models to Maya and blender files and Adobe files and sort of natively work with all of them one use case that they demoed that was really impressive was an AI generated car commercial and what's
  really cool about it is that you can actually use the cad model ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h856frxt9h4xfrecg7pbzk4q))
