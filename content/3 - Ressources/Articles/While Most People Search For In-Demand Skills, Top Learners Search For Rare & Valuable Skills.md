## Highlights
- I call this model the Outlier Algorithm:
  > *To be an outlier, you need to be a contrarian who is smarter than the market.*
  Ray Dalio captures the essence of the algorithm with the following quote:
  > *You have to be an independent thinker because* ***you can’t make money agreeing with the consensus view,*** *which is already embedded in the price. Yet whenever you’re betting against the consensus there’s a significant probability you’re going to be wrong, so you have to be humble.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w90pbdm19wgc82g64yj87x))
- With the Outlier Algorithm, my learning sources started to look more like this:
  • Academic articles
  • Disciplines outside of my field no one else was even aware of
  • Licensing proprietary data
  • Deep relationships with insiders in fields who might not share certain insights publicly
  • Mental models (abstract value that is harder to value) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w95296k6066t96czzd4v31))
- At a deeper level, applying the Outlier Algorithm facilitated a deeper transformation within me. In many ways, learning rare & valuable skills is following the [Hero’s Journey](https://amzn.to/3fJj9U3) — the most common archetypal myth that has existed across all human societies throughout time.

- This essence of journey is:
  • Individuals stepping away from the tried of true path of their culture
  • Going into the depths of the unknown to reinvent themselves
  • And then bringing that learning back to their culture so it can evolve ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w96jdxey3vb0swxgc548je))
- For example, you can read the biography of almost any successful artist, leader, activist or entrepreneur, and you’ll see that they endured years of darkness before they became an overnight star. Years before they became the Elon Musk or Gandhi or Mother Teresa or Vincent Van Gogh we know today. The same is true with ideas and technology.

- Many of the scientific ideas we take as obvious were at one point heretical (the earth revolves around the sun, time is not constant) and many of the biggest technology breakthroughs [seemed like toys at first](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy) (Internet). This 1995 clip of Bill Gates trying to explain the value of the Internet is a case in point: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w9nprf8634tbspdm39c5bz))
- > *The difficulty of applying the Outlier Algorithm is the exact reason to do it! More difficult means more rare.*
  To help you get started with these challenges, below are four rules of thumb I come back to over and over. Although there are just four, they pack a lot of punch. They are the simplification of hundreds of hours of thinking how to better find rare & valuable skills:
  1. **Be the first to learn a valuable skill.** Track emerging science, technologies, apps, tools, industries, and fields. When ones are growing exponentially, spend a few hours exploring them to see if it’s worth putting in more time. I call this [Jeff Bezos’ Hockey Stick Rule](https://michaeldsimmons.medium.com/the-jeff-bezos-hockey-stick-rule-if-a-technology-is-growing-exponentially-dont-blow-the-50b540eeeaa4). It helps you try new things without wasting your time on things that turn into duds.
  2. **Learn valuable skills that are difficult.** Be willing to invest in areas that are taboo, aren’t super sexy, time-consuming, strenuous, appear risky or are super technical or academic.
  3. **Learn valuable skills with hidden benefits.** Humans have value blindspots. They under-estimate skills with abstract, long-term payoffs; micro-skills; skills from other disciplines; and classic ideas that have been forgotten.
  4. **Redefine value better than the consensus.** In our careers, we use our skills to serve someone else. It could be a customer, a boss, our fans, a recruiter, or someone else. If you can better understand the unmet needs of the people you’re serving better than others, you will be able to meet those needs better.
  Or, for short, remember to:
  • Be first
  • Face difficulty
  • Look for hidden benefits
  • Redefine value ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w9sw4mhjtknzm9a9jjwfq1))
