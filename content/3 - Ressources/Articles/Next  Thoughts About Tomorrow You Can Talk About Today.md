- Statistics suggest that there are about 3000 books published a
  day — perhaps more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7cqm8d731dpmmcdfs6maam))
- Warren Buffet, when asked what was the key to his success,
  pointed to a pile of non-fiction books and stated “Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7crxzx4a6yevtghap4fwc6))

  compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7crybh5wnm29p5ketw2k6d))
- Edward De Bono once wrote that if smoking turned your skin orange immediately, fewer people would smoke. Consequences that are divorced from the action often don’t motivate change. Same with books. Reading a book may earn you Buffet’s compound interest, but it’s delayed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7d0svgddjktyaeh2k2rd5q))
- It doesn’t matter how you share, but the principle of having to use the idea quickly gives it a reason to be read. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7d2w7whgd1dbxba723vwa7))
- the new workforce will need to have
  an entrepreneurial spirit
  regardless of whether they are employed or running their own businesses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8d5hqr7v5ahq4yqevzkq0n))
- The cycle of disruption goes like this:
  • Damaged and annoying systems get attacked and ultimately replaced
  • Simple processes and workflows get replaced by technology
  • Consumers demand a higher level of sophistication and service
  • Finally, the old ways of doing things go through a fundamental change and no longer work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8d85gc14js5cv0hca914mx))
- Businesses and their leaders therefore need to:
  • Question existing business models (positive paranoia) • Increase their novel insights (fresh perspectives) • Become sense makers (command context) • Obsess about customers (intimacy and inspiration) • Build cultures worth belonging to (performance environments) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8d7xv3w4m57mj37enrr6j4))
- We can see how the Institute for the Future has used the drivers
  of change to form this list of ten skills for the future. Each skill is influenced by one or more drivers.
  • Sense making — Ability to determine the deeper meaning or significance of what is being expressed
  • Social intelligence — Ability to connect to others in a deep and direct way, to sense and stimulate reactions and desired interactions
  • Novel & adaptive thinking — Proficiency at thinking and coming up with solutions and responses beyond that which is rote or rule-based
  • Cross-cultural competency — Ability to operate in different cultural settings
  • Computational thinking — Ability to translate vast amounts of data into abstract concepts and to understand data-based reasoning
  • New-media literacy — Ability to critically assess and develop content that uses new media forms, and to leverage these media for persuasive communication
  • Transdisciplinary — Literacy in and ability to understand concepts across multiple disciplines
  • Design mindset — Ability to represent and develop tasks and work processes for desired outcomes
  • Cognitive load management — Ability to discriminate and filter information for importance, and to understand how to maximise cognitive functioning using a variety of tools and techniques
  • Virtual collaboration — Ability to work productively, drive engagement, and demonstrate presence as a member of a virtual team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8dp2k5j2pw2y8sjjs0sswr))
- Pattern recognition — similar to the idea of sense making, but with a bias towards data points and joining the dots for action. It’s about seeing both the forest and the trees and creating an insight that drives change.
  • Value matching — this is an idea rooted in client-centric business models, leadership engagement strategies, and good old-fashioned sales and marketing. We need to be able to connect value from one side to the other.
  • Innovative Design — This is about making sure that what you do is solution-centred and directed towards affecting the human condition. Your work must make things better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8dqbtqvj65z9bvj3bfn47t))
