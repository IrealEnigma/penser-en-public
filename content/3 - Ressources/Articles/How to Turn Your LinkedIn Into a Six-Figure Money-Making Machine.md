## Highlights
- Step 2: Optimize your profile funnel
  Most LinkedIn profiles are a hot mess.
  You have 2–5 **seconds** to answer this question:
  > **“Why should I follow you?”**
  If you can’t answer this question immediately, you’ve lost a potential customer. You might be bleeding money without even knowing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75rb9ew8vmdbhfq8q7nwy29))
- #3: Create content every day for one year.
  The habit of showing up over a long time is half the battle.
  Here’s what you need to do:
  1. Put your thoughts out there.
  2. Engage with thought leaders and the community in your field.
  3. Read the latest research and insights.
  4. Iterate your content with feedback and data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75rfafrg6zddj7cgrqmqmbd))
- #4: Look at your DMs for problems
  Once you start posting consistently, people will start reaching out to you.
  Your DMs are a goldmine for business ideas.
  People are literally telling you their problems and how they want you to help them.
  It’s free market research.
  When you get a DM, don’t ignore it. If it’s relevant to your business, jump on a 20-minute Zoom call.
  Ask them 3 questions:
  • What are the current challenges you are experiencing?
  • What are your goals?
  • What do you think I could help you with? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s0d4thb7046msv2zcvqdw))
- The answers to these questions form the basis for the business offer you can create, and you’ve got a list of warm leads you can sell to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s0nvc8f38g9fgec1zzkx8))
- #5: Learn how to DM others
  Reach out to creators on Linkedin whose work inspires you.
  Don’t ask for something immediately.
  Tell them about the impact their work has on you. They might not reply (they probably won’t) but that’s not the point.
  Don’t badger them and don’t be annoying.
  It might take 6 or 7 cold DMs before you finally get a reply.
  Over time, you’ll get more and more responses. Organize a Zoom call. Start a community over Slack or Discord. Don’t ask for permission to share their work. Just do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s2cmbytspkra8ps45ee2b))
- Collaboration is the name of the game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s2h47y9vgvkg6tk7zcrab))
- To paraphrase [Tim Denning](https://medium.com/swlh/ive-been-writing-online-for-the-last-9-years-and-made-7-figures-1954e4987525), “building a brand on LinkedIn is a team sport masquerading as a solo pursuit”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s2sgjvp8x6edt3gjf79fx))
- #6: Offer a product or service to address those problems
  Start with **unscalable** offerings first.
  My preferred options are:
  1. Consulting.
  2. Coaching.
  Why? Both are:
  • Instantly monetizable.
  • Require zero-to-low set-up costs (wifi + laptop).
  • Build your skills, reputation and networks.
  You could start offering them tomorrow.
  Gather testimonials + feedback as early as possible and display them on your website. Slowly increase your pricing.
  Don’t work for free or do unpaid trials.
  They never work out in the long term. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s5e1ec62ncmrhkyjf1rgx))
- #7: Offer scalable solutions next
  Once you’ve got a good pipeline of consulting and coaching clients, start building scalable offerings in the background.
  This includes:
  • Email marketing campaigns and sequences
  • Sponsored newsletters
  • Online courses
  • E-books
  • Templates, checklists, etc
  • Paid community, memberships, subscriptions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s6dqr5xfbmhy5ygc3j80v))
- Why? These offerings:
  • Require investment upfront, but become passive over time.
  • You can repurpose the data and knowledge you’ve collected through your coaching and consulting projects and package it into a digital product.
  • Lower price for customers, higher margins for you. *Win-win.*
  • Can sell 24/7, anywhere in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s7neb8p83t4jfeb4ca7bf))
- #8: Delegate and elevate.
  Now that you’ve got some money coming in, it’s time to start bringing in help.
  Hire a virtual assistant or a subcontractor to do admin tasks or anything that doesn’t really bring you joy.
  Use your money to buy back your time. Use the time to create more products and offers. *And repeat.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h75s88d2f7advaxqsgc33sw7))
