## Highlights
- Zettelkasten Workflow
  The Zettelkasten method has totally changed my approach to learning for the better. There are five different types of note-taking processes that build on each other. I’ll go through each of these and demonstrate how I implement them in my own system below.
  1. Fleeting notes 
  2. Literature notes 
  3. Permanent notes 
  4. Index notes 
  5. Keyword notes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74zswzczcxq5nr1h9t44ejm))
- Fleeting Notes
  Fleeting notes are temporary *reminders of ideas*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74ztks5h19ezka3qfgqb9pg))
- 1. You want to remember the idea permanently. 
  2. You want to use the idea in your work (in a blog, book or something that will help you take a step forward in achieving a concrete goal). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74zva719a30sh56tqfk686n))
- **Literature Notes**
  At the end of the day, or sooner if you want, go back to your fleeting notes and pick out the ideas that you really want to keep. I have found that ideas that I thought I wanted to keep or use become less important when compared to all of the other fleeting notes on the page. The fleeting notes that spark joy/interest stand out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74zwz3vd27gttspy5v6fdp9))
- There are five criteria it would be beneficial for your literature note to meet:
  1. Write it in your own words. 
  2. Write it in such away that if you read it 10 years later it would make complete sense by itself. 
  3. One idea per note. If you need to define a term for the idea/concept to make sense, create a term definition card and link to it from the concept note. 
  4. Include the complete reference for the source you got the idea from. 
  5. Include the relevant citation (lastName, year, pp.22). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74zy6083qv1kfbqwqep2xtb))
- Permanent notes
  There are a couple of differences between Literature notes and permanent notes:
  • Literature notes are written in the context of the source they were inspired by. Whereas permanent notes are written in the context of your own ideas and interests.
  • Literature notes only have one connection, to the book they came from. While permanent notes can have many connections (to individual notes, as part of multiple topics etc). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74zygx33sc0yx2n544wz0nm))
- **How to connect permanent notes to other permanent notes**
  **Connect notes chronologically**
  Connecting notes chronologically is where we provide a link to another note that can be combined with our current note in a way that still makes sense without needing to modify either of them. Some examples:
  • A term mentioned in a note which links to a term definition note.
  • An author mentioned in a note which links to an author biography note.
  • A note which directly contradicts findings in a note that contains a fact, study, opinion.
  • A note which adds something to the existing note.
  • A personal comment on the idea contained in another note. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h74zzqawpf5fz94gedcw87dz))
- **Connect notes with a bridge note**
  Connecting a note through a bridge is where you link two seemingly unrelated ideas together with a separate note that explains why you think they’re connected. This prevents you from looking at the notes years later having forgotten why you thought they were related ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7500jxd7dr26te3j32q52gk))
- **Connect notes with a topic index**
  A topic index is a note which contains a of links to ideas that are directly relevant to a specific topic, question or discussion etc. You create topic indexes once your notes have naturally formed into their own topic clusters (see next section).
