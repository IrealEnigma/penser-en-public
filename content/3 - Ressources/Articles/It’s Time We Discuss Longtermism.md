## Highlights
- Diving into Longtermism
  The entire premise of Longermism is a simple, straightforward, and — dare I say — a reasonable mindset that can be summarized in three points.
  1. People who will exist in the future matter.
  2. There will likely be a lot of them, and we have the power — right now — to make their lives better or worse.
  3. Therefore, one key moral priority existing today should be ensuring the future goes well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b109hbes4hh3t3ma17sv0j))
- Another way to think of longtermism is by considering a thought experiment [Parfit posed](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834382-400-what-is-longtermism-and-why-do-its-critics-think-it-is-dangerous/) in the 1980s: Imagine a child is running barefoot through a forest, but there’s a broken glass bottle buried just beneath the soil. What’s worse: that a present-day child steps on the glass or that a child 100 years from now does? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b11fbt2x3sjkwvm3exd9x5))
- On its surface, longtermism promotes positive values of being a “good ancestor” of sorts by being conscientious of our decisions today. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b123c32rket7873y2k5j3r))
- Some of its [critics](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk) argue that longtermism is “[dangerous](https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo),” and that it allows or even encourages the suffering of people alive today if it benefits people who haven’t been born yet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b12nq14chs2rgwybdc9s11))
- These critiques are valid. But just like everything else, longtermism is a spectrum with extremes and many moving parts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b148j3f4arn88080hc68jf))
- In 2021, researchers Hilary Greaves and William MacAskill from the University of Oxford published a 2021 paper introducing [Strong Longtermism](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/), which argues that longtermism should be the number one priority of our time. But such an interpretation would majorly influence how money is spent. And yet, an article by New Scientist [suggests](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834382-400-what-is-longtermism-and-why-do-its-critics-think-it-is-dangerous/) it’s already happening. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b1a23h5d6e5wencjp2g186))
- That said, there’s another side of longtermism at the opposite end of the spectrum from strong longtermism, aptly known as “[weak longtermism](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1470594X231178502).”
  This version suggests that rather than delve down the “what-if-abyss” and stress ourselves out about every possible problem we may or may not face in the future, we should instead, basically, do what we can, when we can, to benefit the future populations. We should always keep the future in mind, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be our top, most unshakable priority. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b1awedw5wq3qwhatj7q71e))
- Since longtermism is a spectrum, it stands to reason finding a balance between extremes would be ideal. Previous generations ignoring the health or well-being of future generations has led to many of the problems we face today.

- Meanwhile, we shouldn’t negate our *needs* (not wants) today just to serve what’s now an imaginary future population. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b1eg1mf7cmfsbewr7bgkyf))
- “If we are the only rational beings in the Universe, as some recent evidence suggests, it matters even more whether we shall have descendants or successors during the billions of years in which that would be possible. Some of our successors might live lives and create worlds that, though failing to justify past suffering, would give us all, including some of those who have suffered, reasons to be glad that the Universe exists.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b1j6b54pqm5cvr8dr8ay7x))
