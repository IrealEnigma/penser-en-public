## Highlights
- write about things I think about all the time.
  Writing becomes an extension of what I already obsess over: human behaviour, my personal stories, communication, branding, online business, and confidence… so writing it all down is easy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nacp5dmx9d0e8j3h8nzay))
- I have one lesson in mind per piece.
  Writing gets complicated when there are 9 things you’re trying to convey.
  Start by identifying one problem and one lesson to teach.
  You can break it down into several pieces, as I do with threads.
  But everything falls under ONE simple lesson. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nawaqjazy2t48fyc4rf55))
- I am intentionally fast.
  I write slowly when I’m not intentional about my need for speed. Don’t forget to remind yourself to write fast.
  Be like Verstappen.
  **This is a mindset that extracts the struggle out of writing because fast forces you to put words down.**
  That’s precisely what you need to do.
  Make an art of speed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nbf0awpvhejngj478agnp))
- I visualise what I’ll write as a snapshot.
  Often I’ll sit down Neo-style and reflect on the main lesson, dip into all I know about it, and paint the tapestry of my full idea before I write it.
  Alternatively, I’ll first free-write until I have the ideas on the page I need. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nbwdwyt7d6gr3zx4c6re1))
- I have any relevant research and quotes at hand.
  Once I pick a lesson I want to share, I collect any supporting research beforehand, so I can just bring it in as necessary as I write.
  Often, however, I write things that I have already done the research for long ago (because it’s my thing). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nd2en481kcdzy5k0xabaa))
- I speak conversationally like I’m talking after a glass of wine.
  When we pressure ourselves to write ‘well,’ all talent flies out the window.
  This is how to write like you just had a lobotomy.
  **Being loose and writing like I’m talking keeps the writing sparkly.**
  I also know I can edit later, so there’s no pressure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0ndpft5agnfp4w13r9ayx2))
- I write as though speaking directly to a younger me or a friend who’s chill with my secrets.
  It’s a lot easier to write fluidly when you feel like the writing matters.
  **That’s why it helps immensely to write as though you are writing to people you genuinely care for.**
  Bring them up in your mind and write to them with love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nerrtjzf3yn6czvm42b5v))
- I have fun, like a cheeky chimp at a birthday party.
  Stop being so serious.
  Even ‘serious’ content can be written with a devilish glint in your eye.
  Writing must be seen as a process of stirring up YOUR lifeless corpse for the reader’s benefit.
  I’m done with drably written shite.
  Aren’t you? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nfwbn8m6fr51bdpqe97e3))
- I write in spew mode, not editing mode.
  If I edit while writing, I may as well throw the laptop off my balcony.
  No. You need to warm up into the flow of the piece.
  **So start by writing trash if that helps.**
  You don’t run out of digital paper, dum dum.
  Spew it out, move fast — then edit later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0ngxy18s9v16xbtsr5wkcq))
- I have no limits on what I write.
  I prioritise quantity over staying within my lane.
  I’ve seen countless writers sputter and quit because they box themselves in and bore themselves to tears.
  If I have an idea that excites me and it’s about banana-flavoured wedding cakes, I’ll hit that.
  Better to be in motion writing about nonsense than ‘on brand’ with a stick up your ass.
  Writing can be shared in so many different forms and on tons of platforms anyway.
  Just focus on writing prolifically. It’s funner and faster that way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0nhvar8nn06avqb1f8k8cn))
