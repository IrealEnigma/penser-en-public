The author emphasizes the need to continuously invest in learning and personal growth to tap into our hidden potential.

## Highlights
- *I became obsessed with learning when I was 16 and spent hundreds of dollars on books every month. Fast-forward 25 years, and I:*
  • *Have read thousands of books and academic studies in dozens of fields*
  • *Have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on courses, masterminds, conferences, and one-on-one coaching*
  • *Devote the majority of my time to curiosity-based learning* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv74qyzhjksybn18b4ymq073))
- You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.” 
  **—Steve Jobs** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv74rndvggz1xhygfj69kjsh))
- My learning journey has given me unique dots, which have connected into a unique mosaic and belief system I couldn’t have planned for and haven’t seen written about ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv74rg962kb51d8tppkrhsxm))
- The 10% brain “myth” states that humans only use a fraction of their brain’s potential.
  This 130-year-old idea is thought to date back to the 1890s Reserve Energy Theory of Harvard psychologists William James and Boris Sidis. For example, in a 1907 article, James writes:
  > *“Most of us feel as if we lived habitually with a sort of cloud weighing on us, below our highest notch of clearness in discernment, sureness in reasoning, or firmness in deciding. Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts are checked. **We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources.***” 
  > **—William James** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv74s25fjx7fews9xgyc8b5e))
- The concept gained momentum in the 1920s self-help movement. An ad in the 1929 *World Almanac* even stated:
  > *"There is NO LIMIT to what the human brain can accomplish. Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power."* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv74sba1d0p4sq3gjhm8zxmk))
- *If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”*

- When I was 16, I fell in love with learning and personal growth. Addicted is a better word.
  I read every book I could get my hands on. Books on everything from architecture, tennis, web design, graphic design, typography and business to meditation, biography, yoga, dancing, and spirituality.
  I spent hundreds of dollars to satisfy my curiosity. This money came from reinvesting the proceeds of a web development business that Cal Newport and I started. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7503vdte2wjv1e1rs8g417))
- While reading did open my eyes to the world, I started feeling like I wasn’t getting as much from it in my 20s. Then I got humbled… ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv753v2x044a42mah3q7nf1h))
- First, I became exposed to entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel’s famous question…
  > *What's the one thing you know that no one else does?*
  When I honestly asked myself this question, I realized that I didn’t know that much different because many of the books I read were bestsellers that many others read ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv754kmw6y0pzqbkc1h1zgsr))
- Another time, while a [close friend](https://substack.com/redirect/99658efd-9c39-417a-8f7a-31ac810ad0b1?j=eyJ1IjoiMnAwZ3N4In0.eJp5SQ3u4Y3faKx_RfLQeFAv0djhZVtjwYC8BSRI7q4) was visiting me from Europe and looking at my bookshelves, he commented…
  > *“These are all self-help books. Don’t you get bored from reading the same book over and over?”*
  As soon as he said it, I realized he was right. His comment made me realize that there wasn’t nearly as much diversity in my learning as I thought there was. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv7559jvffj6tef3h5b95a7v))
- Therefore, Taleb’s book made me realize that I needed to be much more deliberate about who I learned from. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv75d662n9m4qcs0466ydw4b))
- Before the wake-up calls, a lot of my learning was fake learning. It made me feel like I was learning without actually making a concrete difference in my life. This realization inspired me to go from treating learning like just a hobby and to treating it more like a professional. This meant:

- • **Dot #1:** According To AI Research, we should invest millions of years into our learning based on the size of our brain
  • **Dot #2:** The End Of History Illusion shows that we drastically underestimate our own evolution throughout life.
  • **Dot #3:** The field of adult development shows that adults evolve more than we thought.
  • **Dot #4:** The Law Of Increasing Learning shows that the minimal dose of learning required to succeed is growing.
  • **Dot #5:** Knowledge is getting outdated faster, which means we need to learn more to stay where we are.
  • **Dot #6:** The Law Of Requisite Variety shows that as the world changes faster, we should devote more time to learning.
  • **Dot #7:** For the first time, we live in a world that *really* rewards intelligence.
  • **Dot #8:** As we learn more about learning, we gain the ability to rewire our ‘source code’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv75kxz6h3qpvmcv9qzmvb56))
