- Summary: The document emphasizes the importance of rewriting and editing for clarity, conciseness, and intrigue in writing. Authors are advised to rewrite aggressively to achieve clarity, persuade effectively, sustain curiosity, and evoke resonance in their writing. Strategies include simplifying language, providing examples, and being deliberate in thought curation to ensure each sentence justifies its inclusion. The importance of succinctness is highlighted, urging writers to remove unnecessary details and rephrase paragraphs to convey key points effectively. Additionally, techniques for generating intrigue, such as novelty and withholding information, are discussed to keep readers engaged throughout the writing.

## Highlights
- However, great authors have the discipline to aggressively *rewrite* their first drafts in pursuit of: 
  1. Being clearly understood
  2. Persuasive reasoning
  3. Sustaining curiosity
  4. Resonance — Story, analogy, and poetry ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqmjhnteeps1m83ks9ks44))
- When you first write an idea down, you do so in whatever disjointed way immediately came to mind. Rewriting is the art of finding the correct puzzle pieces within that mess and putting them together in the right order.
  In short, your first draft is to extract novel ideas out of your brain. Your second draft is to rewrite those ideas so they resonate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqnd2cenrzwpdhyngadd9n))
- When rewriting, one of our goals is to be understood.
  Readers don't assess the quality of nonfiction by its elegance nor its complexity. Instead, the quality of nonfiction emerges from:
  **How strong its ideas are** x **how much those ideas resonate** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqp77d2dn9gjqqmxhwvqfv))
- Clear writing starts with clear thinking:
  1. What am I really saying?
  2. What is the point I must make here?
  3. How can I make this point easy to understand? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqpnma60fms1hgm2zex574))
- Simple sentences
  I like to write sentences that a thirteen-year-old could follow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqq86ts7mmrz70atts4cqd))
- Grammatical simplification such as this doesn't make your writing worse. The complexity of your writing should emerge from the strength of its ideas, not from how those ideas are worded. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqrtr2wh0nv4t8mg3v86pw))
- However, don't drop key information when simplifying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqwbybx7zhg07z57vq2sej))
- Use fewer ideas per sentence.
  The second simplification technique for talking to children is using fewer ideas per sentence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqys51j6jwhtbcevs7zte5))
- When you keep your language simple, you can get away with making your ideas infinitely complex. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqqzmrpe8kndg1gjyamr628))
- Examples are another tool for improving readers' understanding.
  Examples convey the significance of an idea by relating it to real-world situations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr0bs73awmswg94r69da5j))
- • Don't just provide good examples, also provide bad examples. Before-and-after comparisons—like a good paragraph versus a bad paragraph—clarify what you mean and *don’t* mean. Help readers orient themselves on a spectrum of right to wrong.
  • If you make your examples fun and topical, readers pay more attention.
  • Examples with many moving parts should possibly be turned into diagrams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr0xqvqtybrrzn7d61bh6z))
- At this point it's easier to rewrite for **succinctness**: remove everything you now realize is not required to make your point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr2db8x7btgdkkz7h7h4z1))
- Succinctness is a ratio. It's the percentage of significant thoughts out of all the thoughts communicated. A post can be 50,000 words, but if it's dense with true insights and devoid of unnecessary words, it's succinct. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr34e2krqmnz0xw9ya6w66))
- Writing is a process of **deliberate** thought curation—where each sentence can justify its inclusion in your final draft.
  When a **deliberate writer** has written something down, they then ask:
  • What is the purpose of the statement I just made? What effect does it have on the reader’s mind?
  • Is there something more useful I could have said instead? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr4gnh654138pcwtmesfke))
- Later, when they get stuck expanding on their ideas, they ask:
  • How can I make this point more convincing?
  • What are the interesting implications of what I just said? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr4xp3tr043jgkjybd12hb))
- Step 1: Rewrite entire sections
  For each section of an article, I will: 
  1. Read it.
  2. Take an hour-long break.
  3. Rewrite the section from memory—focusing only on the critical points. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr5kdr2b87phr1n681kpvf))
- An alternative approach is to call a friend: Have them read your draft then summarize it over the phone in thirty seconds. Delete your draft and restart from *their* summary. Add more words only as needed to make your ideas resonate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr6zswf3dft1hq95wezkfx))
- First, to be brief on the sentence-level, you should remove filler words that don’t add necessary context to the sentence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr7zrnpbkbp7bwnsftmbgz))
- Reading many extra words is also a chore for your brain. And when you exhaust readers, they quit reading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqr91zzbjyamtgd2sm042jp))
- To be brief on the sentence-level, remove words that don’t add necessary context. Extra words cause readers to slow down and do extra work. That makes it harder for them to recognize the sentence’s point. And when you exhaust readers, they quit reading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrm4e79r9pg7bez2e6xkj5))
- Step 3: Rephrase paragraphs from scratch ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrn60nshk7vcb0vfaefxec))
- Let's rephrase that from scratch: 
  > Your sentence is brief when no additional words can be removed. Being succinct is important because filler buries your talking points and bores readers into quitting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrnd01x5hpdafzfpzv6hme))
- Repeat the (1) **word removal** and (2) **rephrasing from scratch** process for every paragraph. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrnhcvz89k5x8pjp62b7j9))
- If it is a ten minute speech, it takes me all of two weeks to prepare it. If it is a half-hour speech, it takes me a week. If I can talk as long as I want to, it requires no preparation at all. I am ready now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrqaa76bxvtjw4z53szgrn))
- 3 Goal: Be intriguing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrraf26zgfq2sz9xcr87d6))
- But what gets people reading in the first place? *Intrigue*, which is the other quality we rewrite for*.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrrpcnt38x5ed96p4gxfpx))
- • **Say something novel** — A novel claim is one that's counter-intuitive, counter-narrative, surprising, or elegantly poetic. It isn't something readers would have easily intuited on their own, and ideally it's significant instead of trivial.
  • ‍**Withhold information** — Tease readers with a question you don't answer until later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqrs1xz96xfcktm8x641xm4))
- I use a technique I call *dopamine counting* to weave novelty into my writing:
  • I ask people to leave feedback by highlighting every sentence that gives them a dopamine hit. These are the moments of delight where they remark: "Ahh, that's cool/profound/fascinating." For each hit, I increase a counter at the end of the corresponding sentence. Like this (3).
  • After several people have left feedback, I look for long stretches without dopamine hits. Then I rewrite those sections to be more concise—or I inject more novelty (insights and surprises) into them.
  • I rinse and repeat until the article has a steady cadence of dopamine hits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs1dh7w2xy2xty9npw9zd2))
- One of the most valuable writing skills is the ability to generate novel ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs30kz5vqn6jpgc4e5ewgj))
- Withholding information
  The second technique for sustaining intrigue is withholding information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs4v279d1g58b3vcdvr98c))
- Storytelling is essentially the art of choosing what information to withhold. When rewriting, decide which answers you want to reserve until the end. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs513twgtep3s4f696egcs))
- **The hook principle** — "A captivating intro buys goodwill with readers so they overlook an imperfect middle." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs5bp74029tbxydwdrbfpx))
- **he peak-end rule** — “People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its most intense point and at its end. This implies they do not judge the experience based on the average of every moment.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs6nbq1nvjnv9x7hbd1t5h))
- Together, these two principles help us guarantee readers enjoy our writing: 
  1. Have a captivating intro that buys goodwill.
  2. Have at least one peak of insight or surprise.
  3. Have an ending that satisfyingly justifies why the piece was worth reading. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs6r5k1ra9stcr9xqvhx1h))
- • The *trifecta of intrigue*: 1. A captivating intro. 2. A section of intense surprise or insight. 3. An ending that satisfyingly justifies why the piece was worth reading. 
  • In long pieces, aim to evenly distribute dopamine hits. Rely on outside feedback; it's hard to accurately judge this yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqs89a14kaz31rx311ps1fy))
- Asking for feedback
  Ask for feedback from the audience you’re writing for. Here’s a template:
  > It would be helpful if you read my article **slowly** to transcribe the reactions you have while reading it. For example: 
  > 
  > **1. Tell me what to delete** — When you notice your interest is fading, you can say “I'm drifting here. This isn’t compelling and it isn’t adding value. Get to the point quicker and hook me." 
  > 
  > **2. Tell me what to double down on** — When something excites you, you can say “Dopamine hit. Go further in this direction. I have more questions.” 
  > 
  > **3. Tell me what isn't clear** — When you're done reading, please score this from 1-10 on how satisfying it was. Don’t be afraid to give me a low score. By telling me this needs work, you're sparing me from releasing bad work to the public. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsae26h0de7trar6fk99bp))
- Keep asking for feedback then rewriting until you average a score of 7.5+ across a handful of respondents. That puts you in the "this was a good read" category. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsate2py605fpq6884enjj))
- Do not waste time striving for 9+. One reader's 9 is not the same as another's, so trying to satisfy everyone results in a bloated post that satisfies no one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsbb0d63a7cyqrr3k6qdsv))
- Here are problems with my writing that I can best identify with the benefit of a break:
  • Awkward sentences.
  • Not being persuasive.
  • Not sustaining intrigue.
  • Not being succinct on a section-by-section level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsdjf016dprr5ev36z05jx))
- A few rules of thumb for incorporating feedback from your target audience: 
  • If you agree with it, implement it.
  • If 3 out of 10 people have the same feedback and you’re ambivalent about it, I'd incorporate it if it’s just a quick change.
  • If 4 or more out of 10 have the same feedback and you disagree with it, *you* are wrong. Check your assumptions and your ego: ask them why they feel the way they do. Put yourself in their shoes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsef7sd181pap7r99q64g8))
- I consider my writing done when: 
  • I've fulfilled my topic objective.
  • I've hit a 7.5+ feedback score.
  • I'm no longer making significant edits while rewriting.
  If you're like me, you'll get pleasure out of revisiting old pieces every year and updating them to reflect your improved understanding of the topic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsf5g8tfjaseqwk8dxf6m0))
