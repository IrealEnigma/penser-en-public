## Highlights
- 1. Spend a lot of time in physical motion.
  How energised we feel is inextricably tied to how aligned we are to our natural behaviours.
  Humans are not built to handle a modern, sedentary, ginormous ass-in-seat lifestyle. This is the main reason why everyone’s depressed these days.
  Energised people do as our bare-chested ancestors did, and they keep moving. To be honest, I believe we’re all nomadic at heart.
  Continually moving. Motion and exercise get the blood pumping and keep endorphins (happy chemicals) high.
  You can’t ‘positive thinking’ your way to a good mood. You must dedicate a large chunk of your day to moving, even if it’s a walk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haza1rvd2t97tesvgye6pyqz))
- 2. Have simple routines.
  The world can be a complicated environment, and complexity requires increased brain processing.
  **This inevitably uses up significant energy resources.**
  So, when we actively cut the unnecessary, reduce our options, and keep our lives and routines simple, we have less to focus on.
  We can put more energy toward fewer things, which improves our performance in all areas, and we simply get better at life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haza1vav0e6p5q0zaz88zz5e))
- 3. Reduce processed anything.
  Processed food is bad for us and slowly makes us ill. There’s no processed alternative that’s any better.
  It’s all shit. Cut it out.
  The body despises manufactured stuffs like bread, alcohol, hotdogs and cake.
  I’m sorry, but it’s like pouring strawberry jam into a car engine. It just doesn’t work together well.
  It may feel good to slam down a couple of twinkies when you’re sad that Jason didn’t text you back.
  But that’s because it’s full of chemicals that trick our brains into thinking we’re eating what’s right until we find ourselves pushing out sludge the following day while we thank the gods for another bowel movement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haza2hyajzh4ybmgdgsvmehr))
- 6. They reaffirm their priorities daily.
  Those who conserve more energy make a point of reconfirming the things that matter most to them daily as a habit.
  If we don’t, we end up being ‘yes people,’ dragged in nine directions at once, wondering why we’re so scattered and busy all day.
  **If we don’t exert our control on our priorities, the day will seize control of us, and this is inevitably draining.**
  Know what you want and reaffirm what is essential at every step. Say yes to what’s vital and no to everything else.
  It’s a continual work in progress, but it will keep your energy optimised. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haza4b78nz43x3b2cn20x81j))
