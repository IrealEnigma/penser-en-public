- Summary: The "Blockbuster Blueprint" is a comprehensive map of thought leadership that has been developed over thousands of hours. The map is designed to identify high-leverage skills, bottlenecks, and the right sequence to build momentum. The map also helps to create accurate expectations and an idea factory to produce viral ideas at scale. The map consists of five mindsets that conflict with each other, but it is essential to integrate them for success. The article also discusses the importance of aligning the internal world with the external world to create authentic content.

## Highlights
- Since 2013, I have spent many thousands of hours deliberately:
  • Identifying the highest leverage micro-skills to learn.
  • Identifying the topic experts throughout the world who specialize in those skills.
  • Studying the work of those experts and extracting patterns.
  • Performing thousands of tests on those patterns.
  • Applying the lessons to my own work and getting tens of millions of views and millions in revenue as a result.
  • Personally teaching the lessons to students in live cohorts and doing one-on-one coaching to help students get results.
  • Sequencing the skills so that they’re learned in the right order (just like addition is learned before multiplication, which is learned before algebra). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5ntw8axb51ed0z3jcwr06w))
- Having a thought leader map is crucial on five levels:
  1. Identify high-leverage skills to get results faster.
  2. Identify bottlenecks that sabotage your success.
  3. Learn the right sequence to build momentum.
  4. Create more accurate expectations so you keep improving for years.
  5. Create an idea factory so you can systematically create viral ideas at scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5ntdt9g6da8p4ehv60sv0f))
- Thought leadership doesn’t just consist of skills. It consists of mindsets.
  Each mindset has a unique benefit that contributes to your success as a thought leader:
  • **Creator Mindset.** Helps you create and express authentic work that aligns with your soul and that you’re so proud of that you share it with everyone you know.
  • **Founder Mindset.** Helps you understand your readers and the market, strategize, test out what works, and pivot until you succeed.
  • **Researcher Mindset.** Helps you understand the best of what humanity has already figured out on any given topic so you can build on top of it.
  • **Thinker Mindset.** Helps you synthesize what others have learned and create compelling Trademark Ideas that are unique to you.
  • **Journalist Mindset.** Helps you communicate your ideas effectively so they are easy to read, understandable, and compelling.
  • **Marketer Mindset.** Helps you persuade readers to take the next step financially by investing in themselves with you.
  The big challenge with integrating these mindsets is the polarity among them. Each mindset also has a value system that conflicts with the other mindsets:
  • **Creators are said to “sell out”** when they get too entrepreneurial and focus too much on understanding and serving a market.
  • **Entrepreneurs often look down on academics** as being “too theoretical.”
  • **Marketers persuade** while researchers focus on objective “truth.”
  • Journalists in traditional media organizations operate with an **iron wall between editorial and advertising**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5nsx36t8z7we2rr5ae44jh))
- Aligning our internal world with the external world helps us create authentic content that goes viral, makes an impact, and creates wealth. The challenge with alignment is that we’re constantly changing and so is the external world. So, it’s like shooting at a moving bullseye while you’re riding a horse. Fortunately, there are proven steps we can take to get clarity on who we are, who our reader is, and how we can express ourselves in a way that resonates like no one else in the world.
  I’m a big believer that “the messenger is the message.” In other words, people don’t just connect with your ideas or your words. More fundamentally, they connect with you. Therefore, it’s essential to bring your full self to your work.
  **Why it matters:** If you are out of alignment internally, creating content will feel like a bore or a chore. If you are out of alignment externally, you will not create content that resonates. The most successful thought leaders love what they do so much that they would still do it without money. Yet, they become so good that they have a huge impact and create wealth.

- Curating other people’s ideas means identifying fields, ideas, keywords, people, lessons, and resources related to your topic. As a bonus, thought leaders can share and monetize as they learn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5p6b493n1471t9j5vhs795))
- Developing your idea means synthesizing your research, creating your own idea, testing it, and then packaging it with a name, quote, title, and/or visual. Many beginners leave this process to chance and just hope that ideas will come to them. Great thought leaders have very specific steps they follow to rapidly and consistently create ideas.

- Furthermore, when most beginners have an idea, they just have one idea and get attached to it. World-class thought leaders have many ideas and rapidly test them. This saves months of pursuing mediocre ideas that could have been tested in one month. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5p8fk4f3vekygpqa672n00))
- Your most important currency as a thought leader is your ideas. Once you have one big Trademark Idea that people in your industry use, you will be in demand. One idea can make your career. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5p9g8t4jahwsmmbxng0tb7))
- Most people think that creating content is primarily what thought leadership is. In actuality, it’s just the final stage. It means drafting, structuring, and editing your idea so that it is easy, enjoyable, and beneficial to read. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5pmxmym901jbjz515wj5qy))
- Your content is the spark for the fire of your ideas. Without the spark, the fire will not ignite. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hh5pnpbcy38nxfpkb3hfjd2e))
