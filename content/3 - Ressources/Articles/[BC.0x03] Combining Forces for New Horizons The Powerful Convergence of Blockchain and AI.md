## Highlights
- Blockchain’s reinforcement for AI — upgraded trustworthiness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhamw2q1kk7s9g7q8a3re4))
- In this respect, blockchain can be a valuable ally to AI — by infusing trustworthiness into both the data itself and the AI systems that rely on it, ensuring higher security and transparency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhaqtzfv2fjxdf7tnrs10s))
- Generative AI, an enabler of fair compensation for creators ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhbstemmeh9tj6p6r6j26f))
- However, the popularity of Generative AI also raises concerns over the uncertainty surrounding the AI’s data sources, with frequent instances where AI-generated content incorporates original works without proper consent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhc1xczpa3rkb9mwk86fae))
- As we were reminded by the recent strikes of Hollywood writers and actors over the use of generative AI, the growing integration of AI in creative works calls for heightened efforts to protect copyright. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhcac0gegs66ra5n54zp48))
- This is where blockchain technology can help. Authenticated information such as ‘who created what’ can be stored on-chain and enable users to trace the original source of AI-generated content through transparent on-chain data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhd62ycaw31htvqt4dhket))
- This is a good example of how blockchain can establish a clear ownership and ensure fair compensation for creators, presenting a potential pathway to navigate the copyright quandaries surrounding the use of AI. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhfd0nc8m5ywxdryd3mbrf))
- Autonomous AI Agents are another subfield of AI, capable of performing specific tasks and making decisions without human intervention by perceiving its surrounding environment and analyzing an individual’s data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhftkjtmpsby9zy42qqn95))
- Familiar use cases include self-driving vehicles, AI-powered financial trading, and virtual AI assistants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhg4dy70g21g2zzdjh3cpc))
- Given the intimate connection of these systems with our daily existence — managing time, safeguarding assets, ensuring safety, and monitoring health — a compromise in the underlying data could be critical. In this regard, blockchain can offer a protective layer with its ability to keep a permanent, tamper-proof record of data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhh161e6te76fpa9rykcc9))
- Here, blockchain can offer a secure on-chain mechanism for record-keeping by decentralizing and encrypting data, while keeping the convenience of using AI in personal healthcare. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhhyeanm5e6dkyes328b93))
- AI’s boost for blockchain — elevated usability ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhmeqd5jq56abw2wp4ebra))
- Recently, a growing number of pioneering services are harnessing the power of AI to enhance accessibility and usability, bridging the gap that blockchain alone has struggled to close. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbnhmps1912a17g7st5gv6v8))
