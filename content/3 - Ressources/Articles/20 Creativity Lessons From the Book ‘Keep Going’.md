## Highlights
- “Whether you’re burned out, starting out, starting over, or wildly successful, the question is always the same: How to keep going?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haze9j1w3h4pbrkrrk3d6s11))
- **1.Take it one day at a time**
  Identify what you want to spend your time on, and then work at it every day, no matter what.
  Remember you can only control the present, yesterday is over and tomorrow may never come. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazeach1mzzh84br8nh8kjbp))
- **2.Establish a daily routine**
  There is no perfect, universal routine for creative work. To establish your own routine, you have to spend some time observing your days and your moods.
  When you have all the time in the world, a routine helps you make sure you don’t waste it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazeavjx9a4bcxz7zmbe4kh5))
- **4.Disconnect with the world to connect with yourself**
  Set a place or an hour to connect with yourself every day. This is a place where you can think, practice your art, and bring forth something worth sharing with others.
  The world is full of news and constant notification 24/7. In order to tap to our inner being, you need solitude and a clear space. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazebskbtej58tar90n127j6))
- Before you go to bed, plug your phone into an outlet across the room, or somewhere out of arm’s reach. When you wake up, try your best not to look at it. There are so many better ways to wake up: Head to your bliss station, eat breakfast, stretch, do some exercises, take a walk, run, listen to Mozart, shower, read a book, play with your kids, or just be silent for a bit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazectj81vfgm5dddf07hvaj))
- **7.Protect your valuables**
  > We used to have hobbies; now we have “side hustles.”
  One of the easiest ways to hate something you love is to turn it into your job: taking the thing that keeps you alive spiritually and turning it into the thing that keeps you alive literally.
  Don’t make money out of your hobbies. The work will become poor and you won’t enjoy it anymore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazeehvvzazt3v5dwcrcw8fp))
- **8.Ignore the numbers**
  Sharing your work online means that it is subjected to online metrics such as website visits, likes, shares, follower counts, and more. It’s easy to become as obsessed with online metrics as money.
  > I’ll often post something I loved making that took me forever and crickets chirp. I’ll post something else I think is sort of lame that took me no effort and it will go viral. If I let those metrics run my personal practice, I don’t think my heart could take it very long. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazefg2w7b3q42q6ws6xcckv))
- **9.Where there is no gift there is no art**
  When you feel as though you’ve lost or you’re losing your gift, the quickest way to recover is to step outside the marketplace and make gifts.
  > Try it: If you’re bummed out and hating your work, pick somebody special in your life and make something for them. If you have a big audience, make them something special and give it away. See how it feels.
  You never know when a gift made for a single person will turn into a gift for the whole world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazegzp7qkmpwk6tabvqp4bd))
- **10.You have everything you need**
  You do not need to have an extraordinary life to make extraordinary work. Everything you need to make extraordinary art can be found in your everyday life.
  The first step toward transforming your life into art is to start *paying more attention*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazem3djneg5dv9gvj5gt6c7))
    - Note: Tu n'as pas besoin que tout soit parfait, de matériel pro..etc pour commencer à créer
- **12.Pay attention to what you pay attention to**
  Your attention is one of the most valuable things you possess; first you must protect it, and then you must point it in the right direction.
  What you choose to pay attention to is the stuff your life and work will be made of.
  > Reread your diary. Flip back through your sketchbook. Scroll through your camera roll. Rewatch footage you’ve filmed. Listen to music you’ve recorded.
  When you have a system for going back through your work, you can better see the bigger picture of what you’ve been up to, and what you should do next. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazeq5as9h9x5g8fde5kjemt))
- **13.To change is to be alive**
  We’re afraid of changing our minds because we’re afraid of the consequences. *“What will people think?”* But the only way to grow is if we let new thoughts in.
  The internet, unfortunately, is no longer a safe place to do any kind of experimental thinking.
  > If you’re going to change your mind, to do it offline. You can use a paper journal, a private chat room, a living room full of trusted loved ones: These are the places to really think. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazerddv660pvpybt2ph2z4h))
- **8.To exercise is to exorcise**
  Walking is a magic cure for people who want to think straight.
  When we’re glued to our screens, the world looks unreal. Terrible. Not worth saving or even spending time with. But when you get outside and you start walking and you come to your senses.
  > The list of famous artists, poets, and scientists who took strolls, hikes, and rambles around the city and countryside is practically endless: Wallace Stevens, Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Dickens, Ludwig van Beethoven, Bob Dylan, Henry David Thoreau and others.
  Get outside every day. Take long walks by yourself. Take walks with a friend or a loved one or a dog. Always keep a notebook or camera in your pocket for when you want to stop to capture a thought or an image. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hazevkddgtsht9v6wszps64f))
