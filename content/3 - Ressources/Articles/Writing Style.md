- What gives a world-class author their "voice?"
  Well, ask your friends what it's like to talk to you. Maybe they’ll mention your: 
  • Tone of voice
  • Sense of humor
  • Eccentricities
  • Viewpoints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqskn969jjz2h0ckkeqc164))
- Meaning, I don't think voice is your choice of words. It's your unfiltered self reflected on paper. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsm2f52y4d18qmqw1bh9t9))
- True voice is the art of forgetting the medium you're using: whatever others' expectations are of "good writing," forget them—from sentence structure, tone, formality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsn52a65y9fm81myr2d1vg))
- *In*authentic voice happens for a few reasons:
  • You read a lot of someone else’s writing and absorb their style.
  • You project expertise or experience you don't actually have.
  • You try to "write smart:" you use words like "plethora" or “myriad.” If you don’t use those words in conversation, don't use them in your writing. It's fraudulent voice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqspjynjb958tjrfce71y8t))
- The antidote to inauthenticity is **reminding yourself how you talk with friends.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsqt1rwf64c6vbw9f3bcyt))
- The authenticity of who you really are, as opposed to who you wish everyone thought you were, is what your audience is looking for.

- Style is vividness
  Part of an author's style is in how they describe the world—how vivid the images and emotion are that they conjure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsry0q61bzqspnxd9f5wha))
- Word choice
  To engage a reader's senses, you can do more than just add vivid details. You can also swap plain phrases for more engaging ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsss0wc7n8wpk3yfp86ytj))
- A common technique for applying metaphor is to ascribe human qualities to inanimate things. This gives inaminate things an inner life: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsw3a1swn76b3qyx5kftb9))
- This gets us back to the goal of evoking a reader's senses: One study showed that brain scan participants who read the words "He had a rough day" activated neural regions associated with feeling texture, whereas those who read "He had a bad day" didn't trigger the same effect ([Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20141109005302/https://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/biomedical/imaging/this-is-your-brain-on-metaphor)) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqswt9b2k0zw1538pm48srh))
- As soon as you have found the words with which to express something, you are no longer incoherent, you are no longer trapped by your own emotions, by your own experiences; you can describe them, you can tell them, you can bring them out of yourself and give them to somebody else. That is an enormously liberating experience.

- First-order description
  In a first-order description, you directly describe how something is.
  > The day was hot. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsyq99qny11vtbyqxwsbbq))
- Second-order description
  In a second-order description, you describe something by stating an effect it has on its environment.
  > The day melted our popsicles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsyt87nr0qprcdx5bbjdp0))
- Third-order description
  In a third-order description, you describe something by stating its effect but not mentioning the cause by name.
  > Our popsicles melted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqsywn6w7t7aebzezk4y4bf))
- To get there, we choose an effect that is unconventional, counterintuitive, or witty:
  > Even the bugs were looking for air conditioning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqszkdpkr2xfcwmwpqd0n4w))
- • An authentic voice resonates best with readers: your way of speaking, your interests, and your perspectives on the world are a breath of fresh air when unfiltered. Consider writing nonfiction the way you sound.
  • Metaphorical explanations are a couple degrees removed from a literal telling of events. Engage readers' imaginations and paint vivid landscapes.
  • Optionally incorporate multimedia, anecdotes, and analogies to reinforce your points and to entertain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqqt0zr75v75q4w6kkwt5jyd))
