## Highlights
- Our ethical obligation, according to longtermism, must be to those future people. In that case, altruism is “effective” because it relates to the greater good of benefiting them even at the expense of people living now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b060pcs1j2e8zhj1j3gefb))
- As long as they are doing something to ensure the technological future and the welfare of those future denizens of the cosmos, they are solidly ethical no matter what their current practices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b06yh15rzga132d9v7tr49))
- Another practice of effective altruism is the idea that you can offset your moral failing by using money you obtain from your ventures to give to charity. Thus, rather than finding ethical ways to obtain wealth, it is morally acceptable to buy forgiveness for your sins. This dualistic attitude to good and evil, where it is simply a matter of balancing the scales, reduces atonement to a mathematical equation.

- Nineteenth century Russian author, Fyodor Dostoyevsky spoke to this mathematical attitude when he said,
  > men love abstract reasoning and neat systematization so much that they think nothing of distorting the truth, closing their eyes and ears to contrary evidence to preserve their logical constructions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b082qccty2v2cddzswvcmp))
- It was precisely arguments such as these that led to the atrocities of the 20th century in Nazi Germany, Leninist-Stalinist Russia, Maoist China, and elsewhere, in the name of benefiting the most people in an imagined utopian future. It was precisely to counter such arguments that the United States constitution got its Bill of Rights. Rights are fundamentally opposed to utilitarian arguments because they guarantee an ethical obligation to a minority of people, even one person, at the expense of the majority.

- Dostoyevsky criticized Longtermism, long before it was invented, in his masterpiece *The Brothers Karamasov.* One of the brothers, Ivan, argues that an innocent child should never suffer for the future harmony of the species:
  > If all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please? It’s beyond all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future? … **too high a price is asked for harmony; it’s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. [emphasis added]** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b08y9gwxhqmpczmq9v380d))
- This argument came about because many Christians justified present suffering on Earth because God through Christ will make all well in some distant future. That is a caricature of Christian ethics, but it does ask an important question about how God can allow children to suffer. Setting that theological question aside, we can ask how *we* can allow a child to suffer for the sake of a future harmony. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b09gypjtywce5n84wp2fzx))
- If this is so, then morals, likewise, are a meeting between the ethical mind and physical reality, not something that we invent. Rather they are “written on our hearts”, driven by the perception of human action, empathy, and the awareness of suffering.

- Moral theory is not about balancing scales but about acting on our perceptions — obeying truth and, by analogy, not saying something is blue when we see it is clearly red. It is denial or willful ignorance that causes the most harm because we not only hurt others, we hurt ourselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7b0j642jt77y38s5c8hybs7))
