## Highlights
- #2: Playing Cognitive Tetris ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qhzygd5tfh4nhe3xadwr8s))
- Cognitive tetris is something similar.
  It’s a mental game that requires you to figure out how much energy and what type of energy you have and fill it with tasks that match that energy.
  For instance, this is how I played Cognitive Tetris as a med-student:
  • **When I had very high energy**: I solved 3-hour long tests because tests need lots of active participation and the use of mental faculties to solve problems.
  • **When I had high energy**: I used to solve question banks for new and difficult topics.
  • **When I had moderate energy**: I used to study new chapters.
  • **When I had low energy**: I used to revise what I’d already studied before.
  • **When I had very low energy**: I used to passively watch video lectures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qj0b9vbbakyx1vk2tt6efb))
- For instance:
  • If you have a lot of cognitive energy, and you choose to do a task that requires very little focus and attention, you’re leaving so much energy unexploited.
  • And if you have very low cognitive energy and you schedule a very cognitively-challenging task for that moment, you’re likely going to do a very poor job. Or you’re going to avoid doing it altogether and not do anything because you feel like you don’t have enough energy. However, if you were good at playing Cognitive Tetris, you would have immediately understood that you can do a low-energy task at that moment — instead of watching Netflix.

- How to play cognitive tetris well:
  1. Have a list of tasks in your chosen field that range from needing very low energy, to needing very high energy.
  2. Develop an intuitive understanding of what your energy is at any given moment.
  3. Match with appropriate tasks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qj15ryy67ejq0fzn751bfq))
- #3: Playing Temporal Tetris
  Temporal Tetris is similar to Cognitive Tetris, but it’s a bit easier. The premise is simple. Figure out how much time you have at any given moment, and accordingly fit in tasks.
  Examples of me playing Temporal Tetris as a med-student:
  • **When I had several hours**: I used to give 3.5-hour-long mock tests.
  • **When I had a couple of hours**: I used to study new chapters or watch video lectures.
  • **When I had an hour**: I used to revise old chapters.
  • **When I had 30–45 minutes**: I used to give mini-tests of 20 questions.
  • **When I had only minutes**: I would review the questions I solved wrong on my tests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qj66dfs2djdpkak86knkbg))
