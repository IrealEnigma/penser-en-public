## Highlights
- You’re more likely to make better decisions when you unpack a problem and shed it of all its complexities.
  How do you do this?
  • **Step 1:** Identify the problem and everything you know about it.
  • **Step 2:** Explain it the way a 5-year-old would understand. Distill it to the smallest ideas
  • **Step 3:** Find out the knowledge you’re lacking, learn and fill the gap.
  • **Step 4:** Organize your new knowledge, and confront the problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qeq3w4jkffj7866bnvmyr6))
- The true genius of this model is in helping you learn about a complex problem and make it easily digestible so that you can take action.
  The best entrepreneurs, investors, and thinkers have leveraged this technique—whether they know it or not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qeqnhn0rm916eehjmawvhe))
- The Regret Minimization Model ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qes8mh2dy1qrx1f617cjd1))
- When you’re facing an important, life-changing decision:
  • Project yourself into the future (imagine yourself at say, 70 years old).
  • Look back on the decision from the “older you” perspective
  • Ask yourself, “Will I regret not doing X?”
  • Act accordingly.
  This clarifies for you the long-term costs of doing or not doing something and guides you to choose what’s best so you have fewer regrets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qet3r2hfe37a5tn22djy0w))
- The Eisenhower Decision Matrix
  You probably already know this model but you don’t know how effective it can be in your daily life.
  Every day, our lives are filled with both important and unimportant tasks. But not all tasks deserve our time and energy.
  The [Eisenhower Matrix](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/management/the-eisenhower-matrix) is a simple way to organize your tasks so you can decide what to focus on depending on how important and urgent they are.
  Dwight Eisenhower once said:
  > What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qetsmxf23wjamcr7dwc0hg))
- Holistic Wealth Model
  This framework is for thinking about building real wealth; in terms of our overall well-being, happiness and fulfillment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qewxaphpefyfccmy586mxp))
- This doesn’t change the fact that money is only a type of wealth. Real wealth is encompassing. It includes: (money)
  • Financial (money)
  • Social (relationships)
  • Physical (health)
  • Mental (knowledge, emotional, faith)
  • Time (freedom)
  Most people prioritize money above other types of wealth. And it comes back to haunt them.
  Decisions about building wealth require balancing all five areas of your life. If you pursue financial wealth alone, you can risk your health, relationship, and time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qexbtftky757yqnkwvddxr))
- First Principles
  Creating complications is a major reason for bad decisions. We blur our thinking with complexities.
  Faster and better decisions thrive on simplicity.
  The first principle is a mental model for solving problems by making them less complex. The idea is to dissect a problem and get to the very basic elements that make it up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qezp8f06mz655met6rx853))
- This improves understanding of the problem and the ability to come up with the most creative solution.
  People who use this model include Elon Musk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qf02vjjk584wqatw5sj97x))
