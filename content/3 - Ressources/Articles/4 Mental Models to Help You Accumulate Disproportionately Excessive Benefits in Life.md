## Highlights
- That’s what hitching your wagon to a star is. **Find a star — a person who’s great at what they do — and somehow connect yourself to them**. That’s all it takes. Once you’re in their aura, a lot of their energy, discipline, knowledge, wisdom, networks, and opportunities will rub off on you. All because you somehow managed to get in their aura.

- A couple of things you need to do to be able to pull this off:
  • Learn communication skills to help you connect with people better.
  • And develop yourself at least a little so that people don’t mind saying yes to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qda54zpg3eg1n4zcw4br00))
- You see, we’re all looking for that one job, that one life partner, or our big break— but you gotta ask yourself: are you prepared to maximize that opportunity when it finally comes along?
  **Opportunities are not gifts. They aren’t anything in and of themselves. They just hold potential. They require *your* contribution to convert them into true advancement**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qdd0y5b16gx8ceyp77e12k))
- • **Time**. Imagine that you’re invited to a 10-day business retreat by an extraordinary individual you meet at an event. Do you have enough goodwill with your boss — or enough ‘*leaves*’ collected — that he or she lets you go without you losing your job?
  • **Money**. Imagine that your friends have a crazy business idea. Do you have enough money saved to bring that idea to fruition?
  • **Skill**. Imagine that you’re offered a work opportunity of a lifetime — like I was. But are you skilled enough to make the most of it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qdekbc0rzq4j4zkfzxtbh9))
- You see, we’re all looking for that one job, that one life partner, or our big break— but you gotta ask yourself: are you prepared to maximize that opportunity when it finally comes along?
  **Opportunities are not gifts. They aren’t anything in and of themselves. They just hold potential. They require *your* contribution to convert them into true advancement**. And that contribution can be anything. Examples:
  • **Time**. Imagine that you’re invited to a 10-day business retreat by an extraordinary individual you meet at an event. Do you have enough goodwill with your boss — or enough ‘*leaves*’ collected — that he or she lets you go without you losing your job?
  • **Money**. Imagine that your friends have a crazy business idea. Do you have enough money saved to bring that idea to fruition?
  • **Skill**. Imagine that you’re offered a work opportunity of a lifetime — like I was. But are you skilled enough to make the most of it?
  • Etcetera.

It can comprise factors as concrete as time, money, or skill — or it can be abstract ideas such as conversational skills, courage, emotional intelligence, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8qhnc61vngvsp96jhbqd5dc))
