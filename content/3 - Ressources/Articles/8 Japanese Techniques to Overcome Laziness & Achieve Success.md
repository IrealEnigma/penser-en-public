- **5. Shoshin**
  > **Embracing the Beginner’s Mindset**
  Shoshin encourages curiosity and I love that. It says — “Don’t worry about having all the answers or being flawless from the start, I’ve got you. We can learn.”
  Instead, it embraces the process of learning, of *unlearning*, and trying new things. This helps turn the fear of failure into an opportunity to learn and grow, and that can change the whole perspective on things.
  That all starts with an openness to explore, to be wrong, to question, interrogate, and learn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb0m5aj1qgbvzvhx7b20eze4))
- **8. Kakeibo**
  > **Master Your Finances**

  *Sexy, I know.*
  It was dreamed up in 1904 by Hani Motoko, who is considered Japan’s first female journalist. She kept a journal of all her incomings and outgoings so she could see where she was spending unnecessary money.
