- Think in terms of systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8j01gx4sskqpbf2pk91wv8b))
- As I explain in [my book](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Your-Busywork-Achieve-Brain/dp/1119901731), thinking in systems is one of the three core principles of an automation-first mindset. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8j01atftcqpe9y6bae03wtj))
- Once you start seeing everything as a system — from emails to invoicing to personal routines — procrastination becomes a non-issue. You implement the system and run on autopilot. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8j0638d25w401zb0gc65nas))
- To sum up, systems thinking is a concept from Donella H. Meadow’s book “[Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8j0g5rjrc8tq39k0jbsbbqs))
- Let’s say you’re training for a marathon. You decide you need to rev up your endurance. Take a look at your entire running routine: from your dinner the night before and how much sleep you clocked to your pre-run breakfast and how many miles you hit on the treadmill. Once you understand each step and how it impacts the system, you can tweak: go to bed earlier, eat a lighter breakfast, skip the post-run coffee. You get the picture.
  Rather than worrying about whether you’ll finish the marathon (imposter syndrome), or deliberating over whether to get started, you put the system in place and take the personal out of the equation.
  And the best part of all? When you notice the results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8j2cznqvd1h4gky2xb1wxyh))
- But instead of worrying about procrastination or trying to hack your way around it, break down any task into a series of steps and put a system in place. Focus on automation, not motivation. It may take some practice at first, but eventually, you’ll see: the more systems we establish, the less we can procrastinate.
