## Metadata
- Author: [[Matt Church & Peter Cook]]
- Full Title: Think
- Category: #articles
- Summary: The text discusses the concept of "pink sheeting" as a tool for thought leaders to capture, organize, and deliver their ideas effectively. Pink sheets help in distilling complex ideas into key points, metaphors, case studies, and stories for impactful communication. Thought leaders can leverage pink sheets to enhance their thinking process and create memorable content for their audience.

## Highlights
- At the top of the pink sheet is context, the overarching theme within which your idea lives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1ajpses3kpgg249q52eyd9))
- The Model. The model is a diagram which describes where this idea lives in the greater hierarchy. The model might be a Venn diagram, a ladder, or an XY graph. It’s a tool which helps visually describe the hierarchy of ideas in play and provides a map for navigating them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1aam6a8eavq2s3r4skmmxj))
- The Metaphor. As a tool for gaining rapid understanding of the significance and importance of an idea, the metaphor is invaluable. Metaphors allow the brain to use existing neural pathways and cognitive understanding and immediately apply it in the new context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1aj42dhkf0yk75bvehfmee))
- Content The bottom layer of the pink sheet contains the ‘stuff’. Here’s where the supporting data, case studies, stories, anecdotes and pictures live. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1ajesf67q109fytymddnt1))
- Remember that each point should be represented as much as possi- ble by left-brain analytical content like data and case studies, along with right-brain creative content like stories and anecdotes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1aqdknx2deq788tbwqpfsm))
- Imagine yourself as a gemstone collector, searching for the fabled ‘diamond in the rough’. There are rocks of all shapes and sizes in the field through which you’re searching, and you know that beneath the surface, some of them are valuable. Of course, you wouldn’t try to cut and polish every rock trying to turn it into jewellery right there in the field. You’d take a satchel along with you, pick up the promising rocks and drop them in your bag for proper inspection and process- ing later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1b12y0v8f6s2p78c8tpjqj))
- Once back at your camp, you can sift through the rocks you’ve collected, cutting and inspecting them, perhaps finding small gems which are somewhat plain on their own, but complement each other ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1b1kcbb7rngk1v9696p0jj))
- nicely once set into a ring together. Sometimes you’ll find a truly amazing stone under the gritty outer layer, which, with just a little refinement and polishing, will become a valuable gem.
  Trawling your mind for ideas is like searching for these diamonds in the rough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1b1scfe73bbbktjpg79n9y))
- In 1124, Bernard Carnotensis said: “Nanos gigantium humeris insidentes.” Centuries later, Isaac Newton modernised (stole) the meme, saying that “If I have seen further than others, it’s because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1b3a7sks63gsza7rft708y))
- Their point is that there is no shame in building your expertise on the prior work of others. When trying to expand and unpack your intellectual property you can use quotes to kick-start your thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1b5zkkxkanh1t8dqxjyw0n))
- 18th century German philosopher, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said that “Seldom should we let the urgent take the place of the important but oftentimes we do.” With that as a basis, Dr Stephen Covey went on to write First Things First and built a thought leader- ship empire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1b7zct5g6p8bkkf8yc2bma))
- All of the world’s great thinkers have built on the foundations of ideas established by those that went before them, and you will be no exception. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bffxqc01wgck0tw0fbw03))
- The fear of accusations of plagiarism is one reason that people seem a little more reluctant to use the work of others. That’s an idea we definitely don’t subscribe to. Nearly every great human advance- ment came about when multiple great minds tackled a problem and worked with (and sometimes against) each other, with the whole becoming more effective than the sum of the parts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bf77kx7q40xednjczrr5d))
- Respectful attribution is the key to handling this gracefully. Always be completely open about where an idea came from and hon- our the original thinker. When an audience hears a thought leader praise another person in public, they appreciate a person who is willing to recognise the achievements of others. In elevating others, you elevate yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bg4h31r9pt1rmyhr5r4ee))
- Firstly, buy ten books on your chosen area of expertise and read them with your preferred note-taking device at hand. Each time you feel compelled to write down a point made by the author, write the point and then write: “Yes, but...” or “Yes, and...”. By doing this, you’re going to start with their idea and expand them a step further. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bh4zdrqs6h3dd4mj192g3))
- A student says, “That’s a great idea.” A teacher says, “That’s a great idea, how do I share that?” A thought leader says, “That’s a great idea, what do I think about that?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bh8kv8dhd943w64x2q7a8))
- The “Yes, but...” or “Yes, and...” exercise helps you build your own unique expertise upon the existing ideas present in your field. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bhfej04j8ajbwbh88xkwd))
- Most authors, like most leaders, dwell in content. Your contribution to your field might be to pull all of it together into an elegant contextual whole.
  Lots of these ‘ands’ and ‘buts’ will end up being the points you make and will live in the middle of your pink sheets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bq5n0p92ersyjcvbntsx0))
- Any time you find yourself giving advice, having an opinion, making a point or writing down a “Yes, but” or “Yes, and”, you probably have an idea that belongs in the middle of a pink sheet. Make sure you capture it, and that it ends up in the middle section of your pink sheet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1bt9dcepafxvtwe5n1ktpq))
- From there we would move up and create a model. Think about what the idea is about at a higher, more contextual level, and how that could be captured graphically. Next, consider a metaphor you could use to help people understand your point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1btvr6kh9pggf6n7sce6nr))
- As an anthropologist Michael studies icons and symbols for a living. He says that square-shaped models are perfect for institu- tional thinking and circles for social thinking. So, there is often a logic to a model’s shape and the message it conveys. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1carftrzq2z88c95mx2qxy))
- Some great models are: • Dr Linda Hill’s Collective Genius: Venn diagram • Dr Stephen Covey’s First Things First: quadrant • Dr Carol Dweck’s Fixed Mindset Vs Growth Mindset: contrast frame • Simon Sinek’s Start With Why: concentric circles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1cbh7p6nkh0fx6txe55ede))
- Your geometry teacher lied to you! When creating models there are only really three basic shapes: a circle, a square and a triangle. Build your models from these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1e2ykn3aygejkm2qerycw7))
- Snapshots multiply fast. One great model may make several points and so the model will be duplicated on a bunch of pink sheets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1eer3wky8zacyjg2441t96))
- Mix it up. Balance your geometry, try not to have too much of the same shapes across your intellectual property deck. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1efqgx8jd8n7axw28rdhrf))
- THE PERSONAL INTEREST METAPHOR A third idea is to explore your personal interests and hobbies as a source of metaphor. This has the added benefit of making you, as the author of the ideas, accessible. By sharing something about yourself in service of the audience’s understanding, you get a double win: rapport and education. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1gzkb1vc2x6jednsv9aswk))
- A/B statement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1h8fd6tkykbqsnq8ej5k1x))
- The ‘A’ statement is the title of the book. Ten words at most but probably less, as you want it to be snappy and memorable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1h8ntccav67s5jb245ks09))
- The ‘B’ statement is the strap-line, the explanatory statement that spells out, in a little more detail, what the reader would expect to find beyond the front cover. The ‘B’ statement should be carefully worded too. It’s the sentence that either will or won’t sell the book — or the idea — to someone passing by. It needs to have impact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1h94cwfsbqaxmjjwhg47b9))
- A: Stop wasting genius. B: Capture and store your genius in an ideas bank, so you can access it and share it when the time is right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1had387eery1e9z82t5g50))
- A great thinker creates memorable phrasing. It’s almost as if they are providing the language people can then use to express their ideas. It happens in some conferences when a speaker leaves such an indel- ible impression, that for days afterwards, people are using phrases from the speech. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1hbr4wcv2z5c12gvmwkvea))
- The audience become advocates of your thought leadership. In each utterance and use of the language from your delivery, the size of your audience grows beyond those who were in the room when you spoke. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1hd1rb444bvk11v9amkw1q))
- The process for this one is straightforward: 7: Make it simple. Short, sharp and effective. A 7-year old needs to understand your message.
  17: Make it inspiring. Word it so that a 17-year old would want to take it and show it to the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1hh6tn2vs0cgwpattvt317))
- 37: Make it pragmatic. A parent with two kids under five just wants to know what needs to be done and get on with it.
  70: Make it wise. Say it like an experienced old-hand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1hhagkp0ts8kmys1hfpq1t))
- All that said, work on the poetry of your points. Craft them. They should be your book titles and blog post headings. They will become memetic slogans — viral messages — and they are in essence your quotes. In 100 years, when you are dust and ash, they may remain. T﻿hey may be a legacy that someone shares on the 2120 version of bookface. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1mkqg6ytpa9xez64xnd629))
- Stories can be ideally structured through the dramatic arc that Joseph Campbell introduces in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. A quick overview will step you through Campbell’s stages for structur- ing and telling stories (see facing page). These steps are labelled with titles like the Call to adventure, the Apotheosis, and the Belly of the whale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1vf9gptgehh4d0n079jmnd))
- Quoting others is smart. When teaching pink sheets, we will often quote Harper Lee: “Many receive advice, only the wise profit from it.” We also quote Oliver Wendell Holmes: “One’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3af8dsnakya1fzk7172hd8))
- When you’re teaching your pink sheet, do more than simply
  read a quote — memorise it. Show a picture of the person you are quoting. Show their most famous thing — maybe a book they wrote, a building they designed, an achievement they made. Tell us some interesting fact about them that may not be common knowledge. One piece of advice is to try to avoid using quotes exclusively ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3aezj2s3et52mk1wahsvf0))
- This infographic lives in the bottom section of the pink sheet, right on the line between the case study and the story, as it is a data-rich way of making your point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3ae5kqqx0g3j8zjfbqgw3j))
- 12 Questions It’s a good idea to catalogue questions you might ask to connect people to the idea on the pink sheet. These questions can written on the back of the pink sheet, and used in coaching sessions, boardroom discussions and facilitated strategy off-sites ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3ahnqp8a3ty7933qrv84xv))
- we teach thought leaders that they have three jobs in their practice; to think, to sell and to deliver. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv1wcz3d5jz9m3tpj4nrrswy))
- When keynote speaking, be sure to focus on content. For example, tell stories that inspire, or unpack a three-step process, or even share some facts and statistics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3arq46a00av4rvxwvj85we))
- When training or running a workshop, be sure to focus on the concept. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3as28zfjq6sg5wt2ta0enx))
- When coaching people, be sure to focus on context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3asmcd5crknfpzp23mdhbm))
- The lesson here is: keep it simple. Don’t try to be too clever or so clever that you do yourself and your ideas a disservice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv3b9h6pn7tywth6g1sgr5xj))
## New highlights added April 14, 2024 at 12:20 AM
- Pink sheets give your thinking depth. You’ve done the work and captured it in a way that’s accessible to you. You’ll feel this depth (it’s part of your conviction) and so will your audience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbaev8bjfrcy1rrwe47dftr))
- If you’re a teacher, or an expert, or a knowledge worker of any kind, your value is in your head. The problem is that it’s often not much use there. It’s hard to access it, or to evaluate it, or to organise it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbad12v30q0z19smx0j5tyc))
- Once an idea is captured on a pink sheet, we can use it again and again in different contexts. It’s part of a speech, or a chapter in a book. It’s a coaching session, or a training module. It’s a blog post, or a white paper. It’s the answer to a question, or a key point you make in a meeting.
  Ironically, the pink sheet process helps you get out of your own head. Having your ideas captured like this allows you to be more present. You can relax knowing you’ve done the thinking and you’re not going to have to go searching in your brain to find what to say next. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbadv90wte1kvj3bbrjb8kc))
- Card ranking We like to think of a compilation of intellectual property on a certain subject, say leadership or service, as a deck of playing cards. Aces are high, face cards next, then 10, 9, 8, etc. The higher the card, the better the idea. The 7 and below are not your bad ideas but more likely they are referenced Aces from other people in your field of interest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbb2zktqb50mvzj7y1ytbs1))
- A lot of coaching methodologies encourage open-ended ques- tions. In this exercise, we respectfully disagree. The questions on the back of your pink sheet can be leading and closed in nature if you wish. Their purpose can be to stimulate discussion or they can lead someone else down the path of your intellectual property. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbcbs49vkpdds1jmer9qwzx))
- The mode model can be broken down into three styles of commu- nication and two approaches. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbb5fjd17exqnayrc0qc6j8))
- The three styles are called tell, show and ask. ‘Tell’ moments are where you deliver great ideas through stories and examples (content); ‘show’ moments are where you deliver great education by sharing ideas and principles (concept); and ‘ask’ moments are where you use the power of questioning to lead people through your ideas, individually or in groups (context). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbb924tn8c30sc8y5jayc6m))
- DIRECT The direct channels allow you to focus on an audience as individuals.
  With this approach, you are engaging a person directly.
  • Tell: author • Show: • Ask: mentor coach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbbcf3zte36x9rdbwfmgzr5))
- INDIRECT The indirect channels allow you to deliver your message to larger groups, rather than individuals.
  • Tell: speaker • Show: • Ask: trainer facilitator ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbbcqgp2nm9gzb2f67szvvq))
- Left to right When presenting an idea to a sceptical audience (or most audiences really), it is smart to present the logic (model and case study) first and the emotion (stories and metaphors) second. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbbrbf586k5acs9vfrgcjv9))
- 3D ideas A chair has dimensions that makes it real: height, width and depth. An idea has dimensions that make it tangible: content, concept and context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbbsbn5zpfwm3380bp4c08m))
- Aces high! Not all pink sheets are created equal. There is a hierarchy to your ideas, some are Aces and others are face cards.
  8. Aces low!
  Your pink sheets are ranked Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, 10, 9, 8, etc. The ideas you rank 7 and below are Aces also, just not yours. They should not be your bad ideas — they should be the attributed Aces from other great thinkers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbbtkv3xnw7xyx805f6zq4t))
- Read like a thought leader Readers read a great idea and say: “What a great idea”. Teach- ers read a great idea and ask: “How can I share that?” Thought leaders read a great idea and ask: “What do I think about that? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbby6tp1t6138xykdgbrh8v))
- ‘Yes, but’ or ‘yes, and’ Great ideas are often built from contribution to an existing idea or the contradiction of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbbyfqh5c4p9hf36qzcgsbr))
- Speaker formula Make a point, back it up, repeat that point, back it up and conclude with it. This is also good for authors.
  22. Trainer formula Make a point, back it up, ask a question, draw a model, repeat the point. This is also good for mentors.
  23. Coach formula Ask a question, listen to content, ask another question, listen to content (repeat as necessary), then draw a model. This is also good for facilitators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbc1tkpg7b10t1c8dcv4679))
- Your geometry teacher lied to you! When creating models there are only 3 basic shapes — a circle, a square and a triangle. Build your models from these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbc4cwvp2rbcv35h4g3h535))
- Book titles rock! When making your point it sometimes helps to think of the ‘A’ as the title of the book and the ‘B’ as the subtitle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbc8w1zcjywq66tvak7p7db))
- Twenty questions An Ace pink sheet deserves 20 questions written on the back.
  The questions should elicit content from the receiver. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbc9r7rj8b5kdsqb06jbxhr))
- Power up Build slide decks from your pink sheets so that you can manipulate them into pitches, presentations and programs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbcj06dvh4ygvdbsp8ym885))
- . Matt believes that, as thought leaders, we are tapping into the ‘wisdom of the ages’, archetypical truths that when people hear them, they ‘hear them again, as if for the first time’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbcqc9yb8bk3av4p6n66knf))
- Elizabeth Gilbert calls this inspiration “your genius”. The ancient Romans believed that a person had geniuses, rather than that they were a genius. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbcvpedh5n5p7rw6r6mc9w3))
- Matt believes that the idea is a gift, but it’s the thought leader’s job to work with that inspiration. In this way, the pink sheet process is the black smith’s forge where ideas are melted and crafted into shape. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbcw74xfy9gf517je9544y2))
- Matt believes that his job as a leader is not to be great but rather to bring out greatness in the people around him. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbczzmty46d3ssf9yqsh26e))
