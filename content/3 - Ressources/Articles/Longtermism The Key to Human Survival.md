## Highlights
- Now close your eyes and imagine that you are standing right in front of a set of massive bookshelves hosting the entire living history of planet Earth at an arm’s reach, or perhaps a few steps away. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7azk338cthntjhbcbd64qae))
- The first half of our collection would speak only about a soup of organic matter with some ancient bacteria (archea) appearing somewhere around volume 500. The first Eukaryote (a cell with a nucleus, a basic building block of all complex life) would make its first appearance in volume 2100, from where the complexity of life would explode. OK, ‘explosion’ might be too harsh of a term here, unless you refer to the ache in your arms: you would literally have to sift through thousands (!) of 1000-page tomes till you would find the first animal somewhere in (or around) volume 3600 — some 600 million years ago. Yes, 3600 volumes out of a library of 4200 freaking tomes, each covering a million years of natural history, and not a single worm!
  Dinosaurs made their debut in volume 3955 from where these massive animals did managed to dominate the book series for 185 volumes, quite a feat. After reading 60 more books about the rise of mammals and the incredible ancient megafauna, things start to get interesting. Without going too much into the details of human origins, [the earliest fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee%E2%80%93human_last_common_ancestor) clearly in the human (and no longer in the chimpanzee lineage) appear between about 4.5 to 4 million years ago, or in volume 4195. Congratulations! After lifting and flipping through almost the entire library, you have found the first proto-human! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7azmctcm10ky4neddq5strs))
- If you thought that our species were that old, though, I have to disappoint you. If you were looking for Homo sapiens, a specimen of which is typing this essay for you, you would only had to pick the very last volume of this vast library of 4200 books. Yes, only the very last one. In this book, [somewhere between page 250 and 350](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/essential-timeline-understanding-evolution-homo-sapiens-180976807/) (or 750,000 and 550,000 years ago, you would find the first Neanderthal, and somewhere around page 700 the first traces of the earliest modern humans.
  > …fragments of 300,000-year-old skulls, jaws, teeth and other [fossils found at Jebel Irhoud](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/genetics-anthropology-solve-mysteries-human-evolution-180963608/), a rich site also home to advanced stone tools, are the oldest *Homo sapiens* remains yet found.
  > 
  > The remains of five individuals at Jebel Irhoud exhibit traits of a face that looks compellingly modern, mixed with other traits like an elongated brain case reminiscent of more archaic humans.
  Here is your longtermism: 300 pages of modern human history in a library of 4.2 million pages. Puff. Since it took so much time to get here, my fellow Homo sapiens sapiens, read these pages carefully. This is your species history! Picture yourself standing in this wast library of life, holding only one book in your hands, and reading the last 300 pages of it. Try to feel important, if you wish, but I would not bet the farm on it that you actually do at the moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7azmn78t8b1bzr7365vx70n))
