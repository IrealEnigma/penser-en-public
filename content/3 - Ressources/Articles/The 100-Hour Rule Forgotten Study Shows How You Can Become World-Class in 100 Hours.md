## Highlights
- The study design was simple.
  Ericsson and Chase wanted to replicate a forgotten 1929 paper where two undergrads increased their ability to memorize random digits when shown them at a rate of one per second. Over four months, one student went from memorizing 9 digits to 13 and the other went from 11 to 15. This was a big jump. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcq9ejy9dpkns0pm5cbt0s3))
- So, Ericsson and Chase had two questions about the results that they wanted to address in their study:
  • “​​Was this sort of improvement replicable?”
  • “And, if so, how was it possible?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcq9jrapbjxckw7d15tx7ha))
- On the first day of the replication experiment, undergrad Steve Faloon, like most people, was only able to remember 7–9 digits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcq9tqv1bypanhasjwmd82r))
- By the sixtieth session he was able to consistently remember twenty digits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcqa5rc6m0bg8y10wmajs5h))
- After a little more than one hundred sessions, he was up to forty, which was more than anyone, even professional mnemonists ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcqaf5z8657w31tbg0r6wm1))
- two hundred training sessions, and by the end he had reached 82 digits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcqam54en0h7v7nhvkfsxxw))
- In the following decades, Ericsson published 100+ studies on deliberate practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcqb8ksmczj5hgh5gfzq925))
- Deliberate Practice * 10,000 Hours = World-Class Skill ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w7s8tcn5hpyah16pq621ys))
- This brings us back to Steve Faloon. Yes, deliberate practice was an important part of the equation, but so was skill selection. Very few people go about trying to become world-class at memorizing random digits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcqdwn0k6rhjbhhwh7bax3t))

- The 100-Hour Rule is the theory that to master a topic and get the benefits of greatness doesn’t need to take 10,000 hours. Rather, it can often take approximately 100 hours if you break down skills into rare and valuable micro-skills. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w7wrx6v7wn5shcvw6kbwjp))
- “Many things aren’t fun until you’re good at them . Every skill has what I call a frustration barrier, a period of time in which you’re horribly unskilled and you’re painfully aware of that fact.” — Josh Kaufman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w7yydej51s8s4ry8jrhgax))
- The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad choice, and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse. This is why it’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. In practice, a large market will either lack a good starting point or it will be open to competition, so it’s hard to ever reach that 1%. And even if you do succeed: cutthroat competition means your profits will be zero. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w831r5w232cqvqbkszkv10))
- Step #1: Break skills into their subskills (i.e. micro-skills)
  Keep chopping it up until the micro-skills are 100 hours. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7w8k9aasxzdpy3ehrgp5fcx))
